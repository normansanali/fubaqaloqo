With the actor’s notoriety in Hollywood, many details about his private life are open to the public, including his height. So, how tall is Leonardo DiCaprio?</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-dicaprio><strong>How tall is DiCaprio</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_41>DiCaprio’s height has been a bit of contention for some time now. Some publications claim the star is 6 feet tall, while others place the actor at 5ft 10inches. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights</a>, DiCaprio stands at 181 cm or 5′ 11¼”.</p><p id=par-4_46>One publication claimed that supermodel Gisele Bundchen broke up with DiCaprio because he wasn’t her preferred height saying,’ my ideal man has to be taller than me.’ Bundchen stands at 5ft 11. In comparison to his The Aviator co-star Cate Blanchett, Blanchett stands at 5ft 8.</p><h2 id=h-dicaprio-has-a-long-standing-career><strong>DiCaprio has a long-standing career</strong></h2><p id=par-5_53>The Titanic star started acting at a young age <a href=#>to support his mother</a>. He had initially wanted to become a marine biologist but settled on acting because he loved imitating people and impersonating characters. His earliest tv appearance was in a 1979 children’s show called Rompers, where he got fired for being disruptive.</p><p id=par-6_69>When he was 14, he started booking commercials appearing in Bubble Yum, Kraft Foods, and Matchbox cars. In 1989, he landed a role in The New Lassie playing Glen for two episodes. He also had appearances in Santa Barbara and appeared in Parenthood, a series based on the original film. For his role in the series, DiCaprio studied Joaquin Phoenix’s performance and used it as material for his part.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_51>In 1991 things started looking up for the young actor. He had an uncredited role in Roseanne, followed by a small spot on Critters 3. Later that year, he landed a recurring role playing Luke Brower in Growing Pains. After the position in the latter series, DiCaprio’s career started taking off.</p><p id=par-8_46>His first significant role came when he appeared opposite famed actor Robert De Niro in This Boy’s Life. In 1993 he found work in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape playing Johnny Depp’s intellectually disabled brother.

However, it wasn’t until his appearance in Titanic that the star shot to worldwide fame and recognition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_65>DiCaprio had turned down an offer to star in Boogie Nights and instead chose to be in Titanic playing Jack Dawson, a member of the low social class who falls in love with Rose, a high social class member aboard the RMS Titanic. The movie became so successful and earned more than $2 billion in the box office and cemented DiCaprio’s name in Hollywood.</p><p id=par-11_69>Since then, the star has appeared in various blockbusters such as The Man In The Iron Mask, American Psycho, Catch Me If You Can, Gangs Of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed.
