DON’T OVERBAKE COOKIES.</span></h4><p><span class=s1>This is one of the most common issues in baking. The rule of thumb in baking is that it is better to underbake and cookie rather than overbake a cookie. An ooey-gooey chocolate chip cookie is better than a burnt, hard-as-a-rock cookie! The cookies will continue to bake on the hot cookie sheet once you remove the cookies from the oven.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Once you remove the cookies from the oven, let them firm up on the cookie sheet for at least five minutes. As soon as the cookies are firm enough to transfer, move them to a grid wire cooling rack. A cooling rack is important when baking cookies as it allows air to circulate and allows the cookies to keep a perfectly crisp exterior and chewy center.</span></p><h4 class=p1><span class=s1><b>2. Use LIGHT-COLORED, THICK BAKING SHEETS</b>.</span></h4><p class=p1><span class=s1>I suggest using a <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0049C2S32 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>light-colored, heavy-gauge aluminum cookie sheet</a>. If you use a dark-colored baking sheet, the heat from the oven is attracted to the dark color and the bottoms of the cookies will cook faster and may become too brown and burn before the center of the cookie is baked through.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A heavy, thick baking sheet will conduct heat differently than a thin baking sheet.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Space the cookies apart. The cookie dough should be placed at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. There are two main reasons for spreading out the cookie dough. The number one reason to space the cookies is to avoid spreading. The second reason is to allow the heat to circulate around the cookies to ensure those golden, crispy edges.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><h4 class=p1><span class=s1>2. CHECK OVEN TEMPERATURE.</span></h4><p class=p1><span class=s1>Oven temperatures can vary so use an oven thermometer to check to see if the actual temperature inside the oven matches the reading on the outside.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Become familiar with potential hot spots in your oven. For example, if the back of the oven runs hotter than the front of the oven, the cookies in the back may become browner faster than the ones in the front. Oven temperatures may vary up to ten degrees in different parts of the oven. I suggest rotating the baking sheet halfway through baking time to ensure even baking.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Make sure to preheat the oven before baking cookies. It usually takes about 7-10 minutes to preheat an oven so plan accordingly.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><h4 class=p1><span class=s1>4. MEASURE INGREDIENTS CORRECTLY.</span></h4><p class=p1><span class=s1>Use the Dip and Sweep method for measuring the flour in a recipe. Do not tap the measuring cup filled with flour on the counter or press the flour into the cup as it settles the flour and you risk adding too much to the recipe.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><span class=Apple-converted-space>The dip and sweep method is done by dipping your measuring cup into the flour and lightly taking a knife and running it along the measuring cup to make it even. The most important tip is to NOT press down or compress the flour. This will result in too much flour. If you have a kitchen scale, it is the most accurate way to measure flour. Scroll down below to find a conversion table of cups to grams.</span></span></p><h4>6. MAKE YOUR COOKIES LOOK GOURMET.</h4><p>To make your cookies look extra gourmet, roll the cookie dough into smooth and uniform balls. Make sure the dough balls are completely smooth.</p><p>Press several chocolate chips or chunks on the outside of the round cookie dough balls. This ensures the cookies have perfectly placed chocolate on the top of the cookies when they bake.</p><p><span class=s1>Form and shape your cookies after baking. After removing from the oven, take a spatula and<span class=Apple-converted-space> press the edges toward the center to form a perfect circle, or take a glass slightly larger than the cookie and place it on the top of each cookie and just move it around the cookie until a perfectly round circle is formed.</span></span></p><h4 class=p1><span class=s1>8. <strong>CHILL YOUR COOKIE DOUGH.</strong></span></h4><p class=p1>Why is chilling your chocolate chip cookie dough so important? The flavors meld together, the dry ingredients absorb the butter and sugar, and the cookies become richer and more decadent. So if time is on your side, chill the dough for at least 24 hours! This chocolate chip cookie recipe is the best because it only requires 30 minutes of chilling time but you can always chill the cookie dough for 24-48 hours.</p><p>Chilling the dough for at least 24 hours helps the ingredients to incorporate. The gluten which is developed by mixing the dough, is relaxed while the dough rests, which creates a more tender cookie. The moisture in the dough is absorbed by the dry ingredients, which helps to dissolve the sugar, and causes extra caramelization. The chocolate chip cookies become richer and more decadent. You end up with a chocolate chip cookie with rich toffee notes, a chewier texture in the center, and buttery, crispy edges.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-3-720x797.jpg alt="How to make the perfect homemade chocolate chip cookies.

Tips and tricks from an expert cookie baker for making the best chocolate chip cookies!" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>How do I know when my cookies are done baking?</h3><p>My biggest tip in making homemade chocolate chip cookies is to make sure NOT to overbake your cookies. I suggest pulling the cookies out of the oven when they looked slightly underbaked as they will continue to cook once you remove the cookies from the oven. The surefire way to ruin a perfect batch of chocolate chip cookies is to overbake or burn them!&nbsp;</p><p>When the cookies start to turn a light golden color and you start to see them slightly flatten and form ridges on the edges, then you will know they are done. They may look slightly wet in the center but that is okay because we love a chewy center!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-11-720x909.jpg alt="How to make the perfect homemade chocolate chip cookies.

It is preferable to use unsalted butter in baking because the butter is usually fresher, since salt is used as a preservative, and you can control the amount of salt in the cookies.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>However, many bakers have salted butter on hand. If you use salted butter, I suggest reducing the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span class=s1><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> — I generally use light brown sugar, unless I specify in the recipe to use dark. This perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for dark brown sugar, which creates a chewier, richer cookie. You can always use half golden light brown sugar and half dark brown sugar. Make sure to pack down the brown sugar in the measuring cup for accurate measurement.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Granulated White Sugar</strong> — most recipes will just call for your regular granulated sugar. If you want a creamier, silky smooth butter-sugar mixture, I suggest using superfine sugar. You can buy it online or you can make your own by pulsing regular granulated sugar in a food processor for 10 seconds.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Eggs</strong> — most cookie recipes call for large eggs only. If possible, bring the eggs to room temperature. This can be done by holding the eggs under a stream or warm/hot water for about 30 seconds.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> — I suggest using pure vanilla extract and not imitation vanilla flavoring. A good, high-quality vanilla can make a difference in the flavor of baked goods. My go-to vanilla is Nielsen-Massey pure vanilla extract, Mexican Vanilla, or Vanilla Bean Paste.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Flour</strong> — all of the recipes on Modern Honey use all-purpose flour, unless specified. In some recipes such as, my Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies, I use a mixture of all-purpose and cake flours.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Baking Soda</strong> — a leavener that provides lift to baked goods. When baking soda is mixed with an acidic ingredient (such as brown sugar, buttermilk, sour cream, etc), oxygen and carbon combine to form carbon dioxide, These tiny bubbles are what lift the dough and gives baked goods the loft we are looking for. It also promotes browning.</span></p><p><strong>Salt</strong> — this is an integral ingredient in baking, even in sweet desserts, as it is a flavor enhancer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chocolate</strong> — most chocolate chip cookie recipes call for semi-sweet chocolate chips but you can use a mix of milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips in this recipe. I love to use chopped chocolate bars as well, because of how beautifully they melt in chocolate chip cookies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-6-crop-720x739.jpg alt="How to make the perfect homemade chocolate chip cookies.

The second most popular type of chocolate would be milk chocolate.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>My personal favorite brands of chocolate to use in my chocolate chip cookies are <strong>Guittard, Ghirardelli, and Trader Joe’s</strong>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>I prefer the Guittard Milk Chocolate Chips for their rich, creamy flavor and the Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips. Trader Joe’s chocolate chips are slightly larger in size and have a decadent chocolate flavor. You can use their Pound Plus Chocolate Bars to cut into chocolate chunks for the cookies.</span></p><h4>How many cups are in a 12-ounce bag of chocolate chips?</h4><p class=p1><span class=s1>One <strong>12-ounce bag of chocolate chips equals two cups of chocolate chips</strong>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>6 ounces of chocolate chips equals 1 cup of chocolate chips</strong>.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-18-720x567.jpg alt="How to make the perfect homemade chocolate chip cookies.

After removing from the oven, take a spatula and press the edges toward the center to form a perfect circle, or take a glass slightly larger than the cookie and place it on the top of each cookie and just move it around the cookie until a perfectly round circle is formed.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span>BUTTER -- you can use either salted or unsalted butter in this recipe. If you use salted butter, reduce the salt by 1/4 teaspoon.</span> <span>BROWN SUGAR -- this recipe calls for DARK brown sugar. You can substitute light golden brown sugar for dark brown sugar. You can also use half light and half dark brown sugar.</span> <span><strong>TO BROWN THE BUTTER:</strong></span> <span>Melt butter over medium-low heat. The butter will go through different phases. It will begin to melt and bubble. Take a wooden spoon or spatula and stir often and around the sides of the pan.&nbsp; Let the butter melt and watch for it to begin changing colors from a creamy yellow to a deep amber yellow.</span> <span>The butter will begin to foam and this is why it is important to stir often so you can see what is going on below the foam. Small brown bits will begin to form and that will be a signal that the butter is officially browned. Butter can burn quickly so watch carefully. It is better to pull off of the heat a little early instead of browning too long and risk burning it.</span> <span class=p1><strong><span class=s1>What Chocolate should you choose for your Chocolate Chip Cookies?</span></strong></span> <span class=p1><span class=s1>The most popular type of chocolate used in chocolate chip cookies is semi-sweet chocolate. The second most popular type of chocolate would be milk chocolate.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span class=p1><span class=s1>My personal favorite brands of chocolate to use in my chocolate chip cookies are <strong>Guittard, Ghirardelli, and Trader Joe’s</strong>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span class=p1><span class=s1>I prefer the Guittard Milk Chocolate Chips for their rich, creamy flavor and the Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips. Trader Joe’s chocolate chips are slightly larger in size and have a decadent chocolate flavor. You can use their Pound Plus Chocolate Bars to cut into chocolate chunks for the cookies.</span></span><p class=has-small-font-size>Nutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Recipe-720x1080.jpg alt width=720 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=p1>&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;</p><span class=cp-load-after-post></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvDnqmnoJ%2Bjsrp6wqikaKiVp7Omr9NmmqGnk6S5osDEZpqhoaBisLC7yqKcrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fperfect-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pete-burns-tattoos-meaning-and-design-dead-or-alive-lead-vocalist.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pete-burns-tattoos-meaning-and-design-dead-or-alive-lead-vocalist.html>Pete Burns Tattoos Meaning And Design | Dead Or Alive Lead Vocalist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./penelope-disick.html>Penelope Disick - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./penelope-disick.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
