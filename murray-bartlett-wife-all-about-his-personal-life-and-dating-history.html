<time>27 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Murray Bartlett Wife: </strong>Some viewers are worried about <strong>who Murray Bartlett is dating.</strong> Let’s take a peek at the actor’s career before discussing his present romance. In The White Lotus, Murray Barlett played the pivotal role of Armond, which catapulted him to stardom. This achievement has also earned him a <strong>Primetime Emmy.</strong></p><p>In addition to this, he has also been in numerous other notable films and television shows, <strong>such as Girl Most Likely,</strong> The Stand-In, Neighbours, Looking, Tales of the City, Madam Secretary, Conviction, etc. <strong>Murray Bartlett’s forthcoming works,</strong> Welcome to Chippendales and The Last of Us, will be released, which is good news.</p><p><strong>Murray Bartlett’s admirers are curious about his personal life</strong> because of his reputation as a versatile actor. This Australian star has never hidden the fact that he has a preference for male partners. Because of this, Murray’s rumored ex-girlfriend has gained even more intrigue among his devoted fan base. Check out the information below to learn more about<strong> Murray Bartlett’s significant other.</strong></p><h2>Who is&nbsp;Murray Bartlett?</h2><p><strong>The Australian actor Murray Bartlett.</strong> To name just a few of his roles, he played Dominic “Dom” Basaluzzo on the HBO comedy-drama series Looking, Michael “Mouse” Tolliver on the Netflix revival of Tales of the City, and Armond in the <strong>HBO satire comedy series</strong> The White Lotus, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.</p><p>He has a role in the upcoming <strong>The Last of Us TV show.</strong> He also has parts in the Hulu miniseries Welcome to Chippendales and the Apple TV+ series Physical.</p><p>Sydney, New South Wales, is the place of Bartlett’s birth. At the age of four, he and his family relocated to Perth, where he grew up. Bartlett completed the theatre program at John Curtin College of the Arts in Fremantle and earned his diploma in 1988. After finishing high school, he applied to and was accepted to Sydney, Australia’s National Institute of Dramatic Art.</p><h2>Murray Bartlett&nbsp;Wife</h2><p><strong>No.</strong> He has never gotten married. <strong>Murray Bartlett</strong> <strong>has confirmed that</strong> <strong>he’s gay</strong>. It has been said that he is romantically involved with <strong>Matt</strong>.</p><h2>Who is Murray Bartlett Dating Now?</h2><p><strong>Murray Bartlett has never hidden the fact</strong> that he is gay from anyone. In spite of his outward sexual orientation, the actor has managed to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. Yet, it has been theorized that Bartlett has a significant other named <strong>Matt</strong>.</p><p>They have reportedly been living together in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Given the lack of transparency around his purported partner’s background, it’s reasonable to assume that she or he does not work in the business and that they would rather keep their relationship out of the public eye than risk having it disrupted by the press.</p><p>When accepting his Primetime Emmy Award for his role in <strong>‘The White Lotus,’</strong> the actor also praised his companion, Matt. This exemplifies how mutually supportive the two are of one another. Matt was his “haven,” he said in his touching winning speech.</p><p>Bartlett and Matt haven’t confirmed their marriage status, so we may assume they haven’t tied the knot just yet. They’re dating, and they seem to be really happy with each other. The two seem to be doing well privately and are progressing as a couple despite their lack of public displays of affection. We hope they find success in everything they do.</p><h2>Murray Bartlett&nbsp;Gay</h2><p><strong>But Murray came out early in his career as gay.</strong> In an episode of Sex and the City, maybe from 2002, the Australian actor made history as gay shoe dealer Oliver Spencer. Bartlett, now 51 years old, admits that his decision was risky at the time, but he feels he was forced to take it. <strong>Telling GQ in 2021,</strong> “I just never believed I could ever be anyone but me,” he elaborated on this point.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Murray Bartlett Gay: ‘The Last of Us’ Star Sexuality Reveal!</strong></p><h2>Murray Bartlett&nbsp;Career</h2><p><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, is the place of Bartlett’s birth</strong>.
