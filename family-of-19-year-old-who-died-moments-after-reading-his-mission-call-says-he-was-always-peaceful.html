We’ve been to waterparks, in gyms working out, just doing our vacation, and there was no sign of anything,” Rebeccah Mildenstein said.</span></p><p><span>Instead of focusing on how he died, the family is now celebrating how he lived, calling him a “gentle bear.”</span></p><p><span>“He was always peaceful in every circumstance. He loved Christ and he loved the Gospel,” Jared Mildenstein said. “The biggest thing about him is that he was a writer and a storyteller. He really liked being in the message of things and getting his point across.”</span></p><p><span>The family is finding comfort in knowing he is in a better place and believes he is serving that mission on the other side.</span></p><p><span>“He was called right there to go to work on the other side and we know he’s there,” Rebeccah Mildenstein said.</span></p><p><span>The Mildensteins are grateful for the support from the community and said that love is helping them get through this difficult time.</span></p><p><span>“There has been global outreach of people trying to show their love and support for him and us, and we are grateful.
