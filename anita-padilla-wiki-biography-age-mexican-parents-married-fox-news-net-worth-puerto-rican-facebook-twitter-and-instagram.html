She’s proud that she started it from scratch, as she should be.</p><p>She was born in Boulder, moved to Los Angeles and settled in Commerce City in fifth grade. She went to Adams City High — and then to work for a savings and loan. And then another. And another, always rising in the ranks.</p><p>Eventually, she was president of First City Financial when it was sold in 1998. She needed a job and wanted to stay in Colorado to be near her daughter and family. So she made her own job in MegaStar. It now has 300 employees.

It’s not coming,” Nicole wrote on her&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page. “I wear this dress probably once a month. No one has EVER had a problem with it. Wear it almost 8 months pregnant?? Whoa . . . disgusting, right? (insert massive eye roll).”</p><p>The post featured pictures of Nicole wearing the same dress three times this year, including once this week.</p><p>Nicole’s reply prompted hundreds of supportive comments and more than 1,800 “likes” on Facebook. It also led to a story on&nbsp;Yahoo! Style,&nbsp;headlined: “Pregnant newscaster responds to viewers offended by her tight dress: ‘Use your time better.’ ”</p><p>Fox 32 seemed eager to draw even more attention to the matter, posting on&nbsp;Facebook:&nbsp;“Body shaming continues to be rampant on social media and it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like, you too can become a target. Fox 32’s Kristen Nicole, a mom of one and expecting another, was recently on the receiving end of nasty comments. The focus, over her pregnancy.”</p><p>On Thursday morning, Nicole was&nbsp;interviewed&nbsp;on set by “Good Day Chicago” colleagues Corey McPherrin and Anita Padilla about how her “body shaming experience” had become a big issue.</p><p>“I just hope that maybe some other woman who’s going through this as well sees there are people that are supporting you, and this is not the 1960s where you needed to hide or be ashamed of your pregnancy,” Nicole said. “I appreciate so many people laughing with me, and their continued support and encouragement.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-awards></span>Anita Padilla Awards<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has also received several awards:</p><ul><li>Federal Gov.t Combined Law Enforcement Community Service Award</li><li>AP Best Feature 2nd Place</li><li>Emmy awards &nbsp;1995 and 2000</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-facebook></span>Anita Padilla FaceBook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-twitter></span>Anita Padilla Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-instagram></span>Anita Padilla Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmensGiec%2Bam6KknJZ6uLXKomSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkmp%2BVYrqmxMicmKdloJa%2FprrTrGSmmaKntqawjJ%2BmsWWemsS0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnPrpyrrJ9iv6qvwKdkn5mTmq%2Bwu8pmq7ChpKmys3nAp5tmoZ6owaKz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanita-padilla-wiki-biography-age-mexican-parents-married-fox-news-net-worth-puerto-rican-facebook-twitter-and-instagram.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-blue-flamingos-rare.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-blue-flamingos-rare.html>Are blue flamingos rare?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./apollo-nida-federal-prison-sentence-kentucky-video.html>Apollo Nida -- I'm About to Go to Pieces ...
