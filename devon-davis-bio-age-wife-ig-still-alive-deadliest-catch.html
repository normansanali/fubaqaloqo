And in its recent episode, its newcomer Devon Davis gets badly injured on the Patrica Lee, the same boat where there have been many incidents, including the death of <a href=#>Todd Kochutin</a> a year ago.</p><p style=text-align:left>Fortunately, Devon is very much alive and telling everyone how he survived the mishap.</p><p style=text-align:left>In the rest of the writing, we shall tell you all that you have been wondering about him, his age, social media reach, net worth, married life, and more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Devon Davis On Deadliest Catch</strong></h3><p>The crew of Patricia Lee including Devon Davis as their newest deckhand was headed on a “redemption” trip. The fishermen then hear a sudden blow, in which Devon suffers the consequences. So despite the onboard captain Rip Carlton warning the newcomer “Devon, it’s your first time on the boat, don’t get hurt”, Devon gets badly hurt.</p><p>And with one man down, everyone on the boat tried their best to revive the unconscious fallen Devon.</p><p>As per Yahoo! Entertainment’s reports Davis was last recorded pulling on a chain and then can be seen collapsing on the deck. And as the rest of the crew tried to revive him, viewers could hear via the radio that the fisherman had been struck in the head. That was the reason he had blood coming out of his mouth.</p><p>The crew was extremely worried for Devon also because one of them suffered the death last year in the same boat.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Deadliest Catch‘s Devon Davis Still Alive?</strong></h3><p>Fortunately, Deadliest Catch‘s Devon Davis is still alive. He recently (in May 2022) shared glimpses from his forage out in some sea in Southeast (Sitka, Alaska), on a Facebook post.</p><p>But, despite his making it alive, fans of the show have started wondering “if the Patricia Lee is cursed”. In response to a video of Devon’s injury posted on Twitter, one fan, concerned about the safety protocols of Patricia Lee, actually wrote, “I cringe whenever this boat is featured, sorry.”</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Much Is Devon Davis Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Devon Davis, who is only a high school graduate (from Palm Springs High), reportedly had less than $300K as his net worth as of 2022.</p><p>Because we have seen Devon as a deckhand on Deadliest Catch, he should likely make approximately $16.53 an hour, $661 a week, or $2,865 a month, working on board as a deckhand. And this is as per ZipRecruiter’s calculation.</p><p>Likewise, there should be a Deadliest Catch salary per episode as well that he is paid for being seen on the show.</p><p>For instance: Captain Sig Hansen, one of the most popular faces on Deadliest Catch is reportedly paid an average annual salary that is ranging between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Devon Davis Age</strong></h3><p>Devon Davis was born in 1991.
