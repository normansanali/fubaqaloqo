She has lived an entire life and managed to settle down at 50.</p><p class=dh>Before meeting her now-husband, Gilbert was a single woman, but when she saw Tim Busfield again. She had not seen him for a while but ran into him one day when she was out with a friend. Their love story began that day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/771dc03f6b67879b2ba5c397dd8e021a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Timothy Busfield and wife Melissa Gilbert pose at the opening night after party for Irish Rep's production of "The Seafarer"at Crompton Ale House on April 18, 2018 in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class="dh eh">Gilbert revealed the details of how she and Busfield's love story began on Instagram. She shared that she had been on a day out with her friend Daniel Robb when she ran into her now-husband after not seeing him in about 20 years.</p><p class=dh>Talking about what she felt when she saw him on that day out, Gilbert confessed that her feelings flooded in when she saw him. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CkyfJvEu0Ww/>admitted</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I was instantly, completely, and madly besotted and remain completely and madly besotted to this day."</p><p class=dh>She made the post in honor of the tenth anniversary since the couple met again and said she felt grateful that she could wake up next to him each day. She described him as "incredibly kind, talented, sexy, [and] hilarious."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Details about The Day Gilbert Found Love at 50</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>When Busfield and Gilbert met at a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/timothy-busfield-on-his-marriage-to-little-house-on-the-prairie-star-melissa-gilbert/>bar</a> in 2012 after years of not seeing one another, a relationship was the furthest thing from Busfield's mind. He had just come out of his second marriage.</p><p class=dh>Busfield said the bar he walked into was usually empty at 8 p.m. The actor shared it was a nightly routine for him to leave Universal Studios and go across the street to this bar, which turned into a club at 10 p.m.</p><p class=dh>However, one day he walked in, it wasn't empty as it usually was. Instead, Gilbert was seated there, waiting to meet her friend. He admitted he didn't know it was Gilbert at first but concluded by the night's end that she was his future wife.</p><p class=dh>He mentioned that they struck up a conversation and talked all night. Busfield even joked that Gilbert didn't notice when her friends showed up. Gilbert was also coming out of her second marriage at the time, but the pair could not deny their chemistry.</p><p class=dh>While they had both had their hearts broken twice, and each had children from their previous marriages, they started their romantic relationship and married in April 2013, shortly after meeting again.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Did Gilbert Fulfill the Dream of Living Like Laura Ingalls?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>After Gilbert and Busfield exchanged vows, they decided the spotlight was no longer for them. They swapped their Hollywood hustle for a quieter life in the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/realestate/melissa-gilbert-and-tim-busfield-on-their-upstate-escape.html>country</a>, which had been Gilbert's dream for a long time.</p><p class=dh>The couple left LA and returned to Busfield's hometown in Michigan. They found a house that was falling apart on the outside and had debris left by the previous owner on the inside. Yet they loved it.</p><p class=dh>They saw the home's potential and called it "the cabbage" as it was a combination of a cabin and a cottage. They ran into trouble when they lacked the money to fix it, so instead of contractors, they fixed the house together, and Gilbert recalled how pleasant it was to have her husband's help.</p><p class=dh>Living in the country was a longtime dream of <a class="me a" href=#>Gilbert's</a>, who got a taste of it while playing Laura Ingalls in "Little House on the Prairie." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/inside-little-house-on-the-prairie-star-melissa-gilbert-quiet-country-life/>confessed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I loved playing Laura because I wanted to be like her."</p><p class=dh>Now, she has fulfilled her dream of being like Laura, as she has lived in the country for almost ten years. She and Busfield even grow their own food together on their rustic property. The couple has often spoken about how much they love their new life away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcGxgbnquscuiqqyZXZy2ra7Eq6tmq5iWv6a%2FjKampp2eqXq0tMRmnZ6knGLAb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f297409-melissa-gilbert-shares-moment-she-fell-s-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./north-and-penelope-birthday.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./north-and-penelope-birthday.html>North West and Penelope Disick 'Moana' Birthday Party</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emily-helen-altschul.html>Meet Serena Altschul Photos Of Arthur Altschuls Daughter With Ex-Wife Siri von Reis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emily-helen-altschul.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
