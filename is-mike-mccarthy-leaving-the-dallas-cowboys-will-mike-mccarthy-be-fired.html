Although Jones voiced unhappiness with the team’s recent playoff performance, he also emphasized a comprehensive assessment that holds everyone accountable.</p><p>The team is still dedicated to McCarthy’s leadership even though his contract has one more year left on it, and they have started a rigorous evaluation process for all team choices.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mike Mccarthy: who is he?</h2><p>Born on November 10, 1963, Mike McCarthy is an American football coach who is presently the head coach of the National Football League’s Dallas Cowboys.
