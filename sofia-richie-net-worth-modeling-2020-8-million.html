Needless to say, Richie has multiple sources of income that have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped push her net worth to a whopping $8 million</a>.</p><p>She recently announced that she plans on stepping away from modeling to pursue a career in acting, and though she hasn’t landed any roles yet, stepping into the world of filmmaking could see Richie’s fortune skyrocket. Here’s how the brunette, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who recently split with Scott Disick</a>, is adding to her current net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-richie-s-earnings>Sofia Richie’s Earnings</h2><p>Sofia’s modeling career took off after she landed the cover of Teen Vogue in 2014 when she was just 14, before signing her first modeling deal with Madonna’s Material Girl clothing label the following year.</p><p>“I am a Madonna obsesser since I was 5, so it’s insane that this is happening,” the then-teenager told People while promoting the collection. “My parents are like ‘Oh my God, Madonna! She chose you!’ I was like, ‘Yeah, thanks, guys.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Kourtney Kardashian Reconcile With Scott Disick After His Split With Sofia Richie?</a></span></p><p>It would be the start of an exhilarating career path for Richie, who would land the cover of many other magazines in the years to come, including Galore, Elle&nbsp;and Vanity Fair, which also gave off strong signs that the 21-year-old was destined for stardom.</p><p>In the past, Richie has also partnered with major fashion companies such as Chanel, Michael Kors and Tommy Hilfiger, whose Spring 2018 campaign she fronted with Bella and Gigi Hadid’s brother, Anwar Hadid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while her schedule was quickly filled with photoshoots and events at the most prestigious fashion events, Richie was still making most of her money from social media.</p><p>In 2018, Daily Mail reported that Lionel Richie’s daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned an eye-watering $100,000 to post an advertisement</a> for Uggs. Her usual fee for sponsored content is said to be anywhere between $30k-$50k, but that generally depends on the company and any specifications they might have before the ad goes live.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These ‘KUWTK’ Storylines Would’ve Been Boring Without Kourtney Kardashian</a></span></p><p>In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan, Richie appeared to hint that she was stepping away from modeling because she felt the industry was oversaturated with influencers who were practically all doing the same thing.</p><p>“A lot of people just become models because they’re influencers. We would all get the same jobs, be in the same space, and be labeled the same thing, and I hated it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The socialite told Entertainment Tonight that she’s placing a lot of her attention on her next career move, which is to break into Hollywood as a credible actress - without the help of her famous father - and she’s already been reading scripts for potential roles.</p><p>“I want to get into acting,” Richie said while explaining why she didn’t want to return to reality TV after making several appearances on Keeping Up With the Kardashians and her ex Scott Disick’s show, Flip It Like Disick.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Sofia Richie’s Brother?

I’m gonna be doing acting stuff really soon.”</p><p>“It’s always been my thing, kinda growing up, I kind of felt like I was stuck in everyone’s shadow. But I’m very different from both my sister and my dad, so I feel like I’ve kinda navigated into my lane, and it’s been great for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2020, Richie posted an Instagram photo of herself holding what appeared to be a script in her hand, possibly hinting that she may have already secured herself a role.</p><p>“One of those days,” she captioned the pic.</p><p>While acting is now at the forefront of her interests as far as her career is concerned, Richie also sees herself launching her own clothing line very soon.</p><p>While she hasn’t shared too many details about her upcoming plans with her label, she did reference Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s success in fashion and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hopes to establish a brand similar to theirs</a>.</p><p>“It would be like taking a street twist to The Row,” she told W magazine.</p><p>For the time being, it seems Richie will continue to make most of her earnings from social media now that she’s stepped away from the modelling world, but in the midst of taking acting classes and reading scripts, she still has a wide interest for all things concerning fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Kylie Jenner’s Been Up To Since Quarantine Started, According To Instagram</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqJ6ZlnqztcKhoJ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZZ2ksaa4yKeeZmpgZ31uhIymoKWkmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-richie-net-worth-modeling-2020-8-million.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./natanael-cano.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./natanael-cano.html>Hire Natanael Cano for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./get-hard-review-will-ferrell-kevin-harts-film-gets-2-out-of-4-stars-2015253.html>Get Hard Review: Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart's Film Gets 2 Out of 4 Stars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./get-hard-review-will-ferrell-kevin-harts-film-gets-2-out-of-4-stars-2015253.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
