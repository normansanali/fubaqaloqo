The group fled as Williams fired several shots into the darkness, hitting each of them and one fatally.</p><p>Noorland urged the judge adopt a similar starting point of his co-accused of between 9 and a half and 10 years and also pointed to Toilolo’s criminal history in Australia before he was deported back to New Zealand and carried out this offending soon after.</p><p>Toilolo’s counsel, Charles Bean, was unsuccessful at trial in submitting his client didn’t enter the house, with Judge Down reconfirming that it was his footprint that was found on a door.</p><p>Bean asked the judge to come to an end jail term of four years after taking into account his remorse, his youth, and contents of his S27 cultural report.</p><p>However, Judge Down struggled to find any remorse, instead from what he had read, Toilolo had expressed more sorrow for the loss of his friend.</p><p>“None of this would have happened if Mr Toilolo and his mates had not invaded [Williams’] house that night.</p><p>“Toilolo received a gunshot to his abdomen but has made a full recovery. Another person suffered a permanent arm injury, and another a permanent leg injury.</p><p>“It’s plain from the reports that Mr Toilolo is traumatised himself … it doesn’t help to point out that was brought on by their own actions.”</p><p>In jailing Toilolo for seven years, the judge also accepted the Crown’s submission to also hand down a minimum non-parole period of 50 per cent, just like his co-offenders.</p><p>“Frankly, it’s more necessary when you look at the two co-offenders because they did show remorse and showed it properly by pleading guilty.</p><p>“Mr Toilolo has not done so … he has therefore displayed that he is not remorseful and that he presents an ongoing and continuing danger to the public.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/8UlrfAuyq3bUdGPk7xtPbHN6aiI=/16x2/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/CU5UYZLMKC5RUXEXKBQIISNPVY.jpg"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm5bEqbXAZqqhp5%2Bptq%2BzjKemZqyZorJuss6rZKygn5rAbsPAq6Rmm5ykwamx0makrqVdqMGquMtmqZ6kmauytHnFq6CgoKSau6q6xmaqqaqZo8Futc2tpmackae4r7HSrGSwoaSdeqS0yKWbq52eZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkawhia-shooting-no-time-for-shoes-warm-clothes-mum-still-relives-frightening-sprint-into-darkness-with-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kenan-thompson-net-worth-209095.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kenan-thompson-net-worth-209095.html>Kenan Thompson Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./five-people-dead-after-huge-pile-up-involving-fifty-cars-on-i-57-in-missouri.html>Five people dead after huge pile-up involving FIFTY cars on I-57 in Missouri</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./five-people-dead-after-huge-pile-up-involving-fifty-cars-on-i-57-in-missouri.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
