In fact, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC Comics</a></strong>’ collectible digital project is the closest thing to getting your hands on something no one else has from not just Gotham but the whole of the DC Multiverse.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>At the end of May 2022, DC fully entered the multiverse of digital tokens with the beta launch of its NFT marketplace. It’s a marketplace that lets fans buy and sell unique DC digital collectibles from exclusive collections that promise to impact comic book stories.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>No need to boot up the Batcomputer just yet — here’s the low-down on the DC NFT collection and how you can get involved.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-nfts data-injectable=false><strong>What are NFTs?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NFTs_DC_Batcowls.jpg><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, first appeared in the mid-2010s, but it’s become increasingly difficult to get away from them over the past two years. NFTs can technically relate to anything digital, but they’re most popularly connected with art. If you’ve heard of an NFT artwork, that’s a digital piece published as a unique unit of data on blockchain. Blockchain is a digital ledger that captures the unique identity of any asset, whether it’s a music album or Bored Ape Yacht Club. An owner knows their NFT is the only one in existence because blockchain proves it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>NFTs are closely linked to cryptocurrency — they have the same underlying blockchain technology, and crypto tokens are used to mint or publish an NFT. Most commonly, NFTs are minted using Ethereum (ETH), but there’s one crucial difference between NFTs and crypto tokens like ETH. The non-fungible part of the name means NFTs are unique. There may be three Jokers, but the collectors of DC NFTs will own a one-of-a-kind item.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>NFTs aren’t just the talk of Gotham. Many companies, media properties, and sports teams are joining this digital revolution. In the comic world, DC and rival Marvel made their big push into the space in late summer of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that NFTs, like the broader cryptocurrency and decentralized finance markets, are extremely new, which means they’re highly volatile. While NFT sales exploded in 2021, reaching a jaw-dropping peak of $12.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, sales <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped to $3.4 billion six months later</a>. That means trading NFTs is hugely speculative. Still, as the market fluctuates, DC is just one brand that sees it as a way to let fans own a part of their legend and take their first steps into Web3 — the decentralized, token-based internet of the future.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Introducing FanDome NFTs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NFTs_DC_Wonder_Woman_FanDome.jpg><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Like any good comic event, there was a prologue to DC’s NFT marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=true>DC offered NFTs to fans who signed up for 2021’s DC FanDome — the fan convention that was the publisher’s premier online event to release the latest information on multimedia projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 attendees were allocated codes to mint one of 15 NFT collectibles celebrating 50 years of DC cover art. Their design was based on storage devices, retro and futuristic, and the covers featured iconic characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Harley Quinn. As DC said at the time, that was only the beginning.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>The FanDome collection was supported by Palm, a sustainable blockchain ecosystem involved in projects as high profile as Damien Hirst’s The Currency. Palm’s stated intention is to provide NFT tech as flexible as artists are creative. It is tech that they say is “Dedicated to creating a sustainable future for digital fandoms.” and that’s led them to form high-profile partnerships with brands, including Major League Baseball. Following FanDome, Palm partnered with DC to launch their broader digital initiative.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>What is the DC Comics Marketplace?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NFTs_DC_DCDK.jpg><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>The DC Comics Marketplace launched with the Bat Cowl Collection and the fantastic slogan: “Heed the call. Join a faction.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>DC offered collectibles that tie into the events of comics, promising a two-year journey into the DC Universe, with exclusive benefits and interaction with future storylines.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>The launch Bat Cowl collection offered up to 200,000 unique 3D Bat Cowls NFTs, available for a pre-sale period to previous attendees of FanDome, then accessible through trades on the DC Marketplace.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>What do you get with DC NFTs?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NFTs_DC_Batman_The_Legacy_Cowl.jpg><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Fans who minted a Bat Cowl received a unique cowl NFT, distinguished by various traits, including material, lighting effect, and background, with regularly updating features. They also gained access to Bat Faction HQ and Snapchat AR lenses. Particularly intriguing was the integrated storytelling, where cowl owners were promised a chance to influence future comics. One vote saw NFT owners choose the cover for Batman: The Legacy Cowl #1.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>How can you get involved in DC NFTs?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NFTs_DC_The_Batman_poster_collection.jpg><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>The Bat Cowl collection was just the start. DC has a regular schedule of new NFT launches planned. At each launch, fans can build their DC NFT collection by purchasing them with credit or debit cards or existing account credit balances. Payment via cryptocurrency wallets is expected soon.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>DC NFT collections launched so far include:</p><ul data-current-count=286.5 data-injectable=false><li>GCDK Sigil Collection</li><li>The Harley Quinn Freakin Awesome Boxes of Mayhem</li><li>the Harley Quinn Charm Offensive</li><li>DC FanDome 2021 Collection</li><li>The Batman Collection</li></ul><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=863.5 data-injectable=true>An interesting new collection arrived in October 2022. The DC Collectible Comics Collection is a series of NFT-minted legacy and minted DC comics that include a fully readable digital version. The first release was unsurprisingly the man of Steel’s iconic first appearance in his own title, 1939’s Superman #1. In its original first edition paper form, that’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive comic on the planet</a>, but early adopters in fall 2022 could pick up an NFT version from $9.99. This comic collection is constantly growing, with Poison Ivy covers launching in January 2023.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Once an NFT has been purchased, fans can trade their NFTs on the official DC NFT Marketplace Beta. Beta means the marketplace is evolving, with new features being rolled out while it’s live. The mechanics are familiar from eBay or even trading card trading.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>To <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sell an NFT</a>, fans must sign in, verify their identity, and list their item at a target price. Fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">looking to buy</a> just need to sign in, browse the listings and make a purchase.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Of course, this is a free market involving limited quantities of unique commodities. Once a launch sells out, the marketplace is the only place fans can grab a copy, and the sellers know that. Resale prices range from $4.00 to $9,999,999,999 — an asking price that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would make it the most expensive NFT ever sold </a>and would probably make Bruce Wayne think twice.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=false>It’s a unique opportunity to purchase a digital slice of the DC multiverse. However, every fan should use the detective skills of the Dark Knight to explore the collections and decide if this part of the comic book giant is for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1osCMmqmeZZSYeqS7zKKarGWem8G0ecCnm2agn6x6pK3NZrCorV2fvKq6jK2fnmWdlr%2BssdOpo5qblWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-dc-comics-nfts-and-how-can-you-join-the-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-coached-both-the-chicago-bulls-and-the-la-lakers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-coached-both-the-chicago-bulls-and-the-la-lakers.html>Who coached both the Chicago Bulls and the LA Lakers?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./thora-birch-bra-size-age-weight-height-measurements.html>Thora Birch Bra Size, Age, Weight, Height, Measurements</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./thora-birch-bra-size-age-weight-height-measurements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
