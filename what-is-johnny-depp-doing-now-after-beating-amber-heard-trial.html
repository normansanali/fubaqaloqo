Unlike the libel case in the United Kingdom a couple of years previous, Heard was found liable on all three defamation counts. This was in response to her op-ed published in 2018, which clearly implied that he had done some horrendous things despite not naming Depp. The defamation hurt Depp's reputation in Hollywood, among his peers and fans, and had a financial impact on his career. At least, according to the results of the lawsuit, this is the case.</p><p>According to People, Amber Heard released a statement following her loss that declared that her life as she knew it was "destroyed" by the results. Heard also claimed that she lost all faith in the American legal system which she stated valued "popularity and power" rather than "reason and due process."</p><p>Following this, Heard moved her and her daughter Oonagh Paige to Spain, far away from Depp's fanbase and the leering eyes of the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Amber Heard Ever Donate Her Divorce Settlement After Being Exposed In Court For Lying?</a></span></p><p>"Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted to leave over six years ago</a> and on terms I can agree to," Amber Heard said in her statement, according to People. "I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward."</p><p>Of course, all of this and more is examined at length in Netlfix's docuseries, Depp V Heard, which was released on August 16th, 2023.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-amber-heard-owe-johnny-depp-for-defamation><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Does Amber Heard Owe Johnny Depp For Defamation?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/is-johnny-depp-close-to-his-kids-after-his-legal-battle-with-amber-heard_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, Amber Heard was ordered to pay $10.35 million in damages to Depp. Depp was also found guilty of defamation on one count (unlike Heard's three), and was ordered to pay her $2 million Both filed for appeals, according to Us Weekly, and reached a settlement in December 2022.</p><p>The final result was Heard would pay Depp $1 million.

He is currently living in England.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp, who has been criticized for overspending his net worth, has owned many properties around the world. This includes his island in the Caribbean.

"I have various houses in various places and they all mean something special to me. I don't have them just to say I own them, I have them for use and because they are a bit special."</p><p>The main reason he adores his property in Somerset is the privacy.</p><p>"British people are cool and will greet you as if you are a neighbor without going over the top," Depp said to Somerset Life. "I don't mind if people want an autograph or a brief chat but not when I am having some private time with my family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also added, "I can go into shops without being surrounded by people wanting selfies. I don't mind that up to a point, but sometimes it gets a little too crowded."</p><p>So, while Johnny Depp has been used to the wild party life, as exposed in Depp V Heard, it seems as though he has really settled down in the country. Life is slower and he can focus on what really matters as well as avoid getting into trouble.</p><h2 id=is-johnny-depp-dating-after-the-amber-heard-trial><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Is Johnny Depp Dating After The Amber Heard Trial?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Much-Is-Johnny-Depps-Lawyer-Camille-Vasquez-Worth.jpg><p>Given that Depp V Heard, and the trial it covers, focuses on the relationship between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, many wonder if the latter is dating again.

But it ended by November.</p><p>According to a statement from an insider given to People far more recently, Johnny Depp has been dating around but does not have a girlfriend.</p><p>So while Depp has had a number of high-profile relationships before, including with the mother of his children Vanessa Pardis, Winona Ryder, and, yes, Amber Heard, it appears as though he is keeping his personal life on the down-low since the trial.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-is-focused-on-his-career-comeback><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Johnny Depp Is Focused On His Career Comeback</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dead-mans-chest.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Depp (who is 59) has been doing his best to focus on work since winning the U.S.-based defamation case against his ex-wife, Amber Heard. This, of course, includes pursuing his love of music and touring with his band, The Hollywood Vampires. Immediately after the case wrapped up, Depp toured with Jeff Beck. Of course, Beck tragically lost his life in January 2023 at the age of 78.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Will Not Be Returning To ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ After Disney “Abandoned” Him During Amber Heard Trial</a></span></p><p>Depp's focus, however, has been on regaining the clout he once had in his movie career.
