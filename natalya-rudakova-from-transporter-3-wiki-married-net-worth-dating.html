<time>23 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><span id=Who_is_Natalya_Rudakova>Who is Natalya Rudakova?</span></h2><p>Natalya Rudakova was born on 14 February 1985, in Leningrad, Russia, and is an actress, best known for her leading role in the film “Transporter 3”. She was initially working as a hairdresser before being discovered, but her role in that film opened her up to numerous other opportunities.</p><h2><span id=The_Wealth_of_Natalya_Rudakova>The Wealth of Natalya Rudakova</span></h2><p>How rich is Natalya Rudakova? As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is over $5 million, earned largely through a successful career in acting. She’s also worked on several independent films and television projects, and as she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>At an early age, Natalya showed a strong interest in acting, and often went to the theatre with her mother, where her enthusiasm for performing was built. During her teens, her family migrated to the US, settling in New York City, at which point Natalya took a step back from her acting interests. She didn’t pursue any significant acting projects, and decided to work as a hairdresser. It was when she was working there that she was spotted by Luc Besson, who was a co-writer of the film “Transporter 3”. He invited her to take more acting lessons, before casting her in the film he was working on, which she did for half a year, getting the chance to work with experienced film personnel. He paid for 25 acting lessons over that time period, and while she resided in Paris.</p><figure id=attachment_2251 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2251 class="wp-caption alignnone">Image source</figure><h2><span id=Transporter_3>Transporter 3</span></h2><p>“Transporter 3” is the third and final installment of the “Transporter” trilogy, an action film starring Jason Statham and Francois Berleand. It is the first film in the series to be directed by Olivier Megaton and follows the story of Frank Martin (Statham) working as a professional transporter. He has returned to France to continue his work as a low profile package delivery guy who doesn’t ask any questions. Rudakova plays the character Valentina whom Jason’s character has to accompany, due to complications with a transport job. According to Roger, they were interested in her specifically because of her heavily freckling, unusual in leading ladies.</p><p>Posted by Natalya Rudakova on&nbsp;Saturday, October 1, 2011</p><p>The film was shot for 16 weeks in France, and in Odessa, Ukraine, before it was released in the US by Lionsgate Films, and opened in seventh spot at the box office, grossing a total of $109 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing film in the trilogy, also receiving $20 million in revenue from DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases. However, reviews of the film were low and critics stated that it was the weakest in the trilogy, evident with the lack of energy. Fan reviews were also ranging from mixed to average.</p><h2><span id=Other_Projects>Other Projects</span></h2><p>Despite the mixed success of “Transporter 3”, the film was enough to push Natalya into the limelight,t and soon she was receiving numerous acting offers. In 2010, she appeared in the television documentary mini-series entitled “The American Dream: An Illusion or Reality for Belarus Immigrants”. The following year, she had two film projects, one of which was entitled “The One”, a romantic comedy about a man who before getting married, unexpectedly falls in love with another man from his past. The other film project was entitled “A Novel Romance” which is a Hallmark television film following the story of a romance novelist who falls in love with his biggest critic.</p><p>In 2014, she was cast in the short film entitled “Waiting for a Train”, which follows the story of two young adults who fall in love and then struggle to overcome a health problem. The following year, she had another film project entitled “Before the Snow”, in which she played the character Natalie in the story following a man who is diagnosed with a terminal disease, and must come to grips with a broken past. She also worked on the project entitled “It’s Not You: Shelly”, and was at that time was also invited to do modelling work. She has now been featured in several magazines over the course of her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/50minds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1645412162_237_Natalya-Rudakova-from-Transporter-3-Wiki-Married-Net-Worth-Dating.jpg><h2><span id=Personal_Life_and_Social_Media>Personal Life and Social Media</span></h2><p>For her personal life, it is known that Rudakova is single, and she has kept this aspect of her life away from the media spotlight. She has been seen in photos with a man on social media, but no details have been shared about him and it is not known if he is her boyfriend or if they are married.</p><p>Speaking of social media, it is one of the ways that Natalya has kept in touch with her followers. She maintains a strong online presence through <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# title="- Natalya Rudakova from “Transporter 3” Wiki: Married, Net Worth, Dating">Instagram</a> and Facebook, though there are doubts regarding her Facebook profile as it has not been updated since 2013. Many believe that it is a fake account as it has not posted anything personal aside from professional photo shoots done in the past. Her Instagram account is legitimate, and has a lot more recent and personal photos. She mentions that she is now living in Los Angeles, and continues to do a lot of modelling work while travelling. She also goes to various public events. There have not been any new posts or information regarding upcoming projects, which implies that she may be currently inactive in terms of acting projects. She hasn’t really had any big projects since “Transporter 3”, and so didn’t break through into the industry after that project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGilmqyRocaiedGum5qjn6uubrLRqKRmrKKWu7S8zqurnqpdaHq4tcqiZKaZoqe2prCMp5ytZaekv7W0jJ2YraGenHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnatalya-rudakova-from-transporter-3-wiki-married-net-worth-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./levi-blaze-sean-paul-son-jodi-stewart.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./levi-blaze-sean-paul-son-jodi-stewart.html>Meet Levi Blaze Photos Of Sean Pauls Son With Wife Jodi Stewart</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kareem-abdul-jabbar-new-wife-is-he-married-again.html>Kareem Abdul Jabbar | New Wife: Is He Married Again?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kareem-abdul-jabbar-new-wife-is-he-married-again.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
