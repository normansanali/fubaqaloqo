With that in mind and Cena's past wrestling career, some observers have questioned if he has used steroids.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>what Cena has said about whether he has used steroids</strong>.

During that appearance, Stern brought up to Cena that, unlike many wrestlers who've admitted using steroids in the past, Cena has always insisted he never did that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/did-hollywood-force-john-cena-to-change-hairstyles_.jpg><p>Without missing a beat, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cena told Stern that he has still never used steroids</a>. Stern followed that by asking Cena how big he thought he could have been if he did use steroids. Instead of answering that, <strong>Cena explained why he has chosen to never use steroids</strong>.</p><p>“If you hit the gas peddle too early, you can get a lot of bad stuff happen long term.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stern then asked Cena if he had ever been pushed to use steroids. After Cena responded, "Not really." he explained why he thinks that has never happened.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jeremy-Allen-White-The-Bear-on-Hulu.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jeremy Allen White Keeps His Body Ripped With An Intense Workout Routine And Diet</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Bear's Jeremy Allen White is turning a lot of heads with his jacked arms which he works hard to maintain.</span><p>“Hell, I’ve been 225 pounds since I was 17 years old. So, I always filled out my frame okay. I started lifting at thirteen. And, I guess that’s why I’ve never needed it.”</p><p>Years before Cena spoke to Stern, he was interviewed by CNN in 2007 and asked about steroid use. For CNN viewers at that time, they got the impression that Cena was implying that he'd used steroids in the past.</p><p>“This is a crazy question and it’s something that’s tough to answer just because of the way society is now. The way people conceive things, because performance-enhancing drugs have got the spotlight and it’s a hot thing to talk about. I can’t tell you that I haven’t, but you’ll never be able to prove that I have.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/nathan-fillion-s-shocking-weight-loss-rumors-divided-rookie-fans-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nathan Fillion's Shocking Weight Loss Rumors Divided Rookie Fans</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After The Rookie's Nathan Fillion lost a staggering amount of weight, the show's fans have been arguing about his transformation.</span><p>However, after CNN aired their footage of Cena, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">they would be exposed for manipulating what Cena said</a>. As a 2007 Baltimore Sun article revealed, WWE filmed Cena's CNN interview which allowed them to reveal what had really been said. The full quote reveals that <strong>Cena has consistently denied ever using steroids for more than fifteen years now</strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Which wrestlers have admitted and which have denied steroid use</a>, according to The Sportster?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Wrestler:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Admitted or Denied?:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Superstar Billy Graham</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ryback</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hulk Hogan</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Ultimate Warrior</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lex Luger</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>William Regal</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</p></td><td><p>Admitted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sin Cara</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kane</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Braun Strowman</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mark Henry</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dave Bautista</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jinder Mahal</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Roman Reigns</p></td><td><p>Denied</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he has ever used steroids, Cena instantly responded, "Absolutely not." After the interviewer pressed Cena on that claim, Cena then went on to explain that people may not believe him, but he has taken and passed a slew of tests.</p><p>“I can’t tell you that I haven’t because each one of you out there has an opinion on how I carry myself, and I can take a million tests – I’ve been tested for drugs since I was 17 years old. I can take a million tests. I can pass every one of them. As soon as I pass it, there’s some guy on the other end going ‘Oh, there’s masking agents, there’s this, there’s that.’</p><p>Cena went on to say, “No matter what I say, you’ll have your own opinion.”</p><h2 id=inside-john-cena-39-s-workout-routine>Inside John Cena's Workout Routine</h2><p>To discover the key to John Cena's incredible body, the team at Muscle and Fitness spoke to his personal trainer, Rob MacIntyre. As Cena's long-time trainer, MacIntyre was able to detail <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">some of the workouts that the wrestler and actor puts his body through</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/john-cena-yelling.jpg><p>On day one, Cena focuses on working out his upper body. Unsurprisingly, Cena throws around a lot of weight to look as muscular as he does but MacIntyre mostly didn't provide any specific numbers.</p><p>According to MacIntyre, Cena starts with barbell bench presses, pause bench presses, close-grip barbell bench presses, and plate pushups. From there, Cena performs inverted rows, machine pelvic flies, dumbbell bench presses, and cable rear delt presses. In each case, Cena performs three sets with varying numbers of reps.</p><p>Day two is also focused on Cena's impressive upper body. That workout starts with some clean jerks and continues with incline barbell bench presses. Cena goes on to perform dumbbell lateral raises, barbell bench presses, chin-ups, triceps press-downs, and isometric back extensions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/john-cena-finally-revealed-the-truth-about-his-feud-with-dwayne-johnson-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>John Cena Finally Revealed The Truth About His Feud With Dwayne Johnson</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dwayne Johnson leaving The WWE for an acting career caused a very serious feud between he and John Cena.</span><p>Day three of Cena's workouts that MacIntyre outlined is designed to work out his lower body. Even though days one and two sound intense, day three is the one with the highest number of exercises.</p><p>Cena begins that day by performing barbell landmines, decline barbell situps, barbell side bends, and cleans. From there, Cena moves on to snatch-grip shrugs, hanging snatches, back squats, pause squats, and barbell front squats.</p><p>In 2022, the former WWE wreslter Claudio "Cesaro" Castagnoli <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spoke about John Cena's tireless work ethic</a> . "He shows you. He does it every day. He lives it. If he tells you to watch all the matches, he’s sitting there at the monitor watching all the matches. If he tells you you should work out, he is there working out early in the morning."</p><p>Learning what exercises Cena performs obviously is interesting for anyone who wants to look like the wrestler and actor. However, it was during an interview with Chris Van Vliet that Cena really revealed <strong>the key to his body, his incredible work ethic</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/john-cena-looking-exhausted.jpg><p>Back when John Cena was still mostly focused on the WWE, he suffered a torn pectoral muscle before the 2008 Royal Rumble. That injury was supposed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">keep Cena in recovery for six months to a year</a> after he underwent surgery. Amazingly enough, however, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cena returned at the Royal Rumble after only three months of rehab</a>.</p><p>In 2024, Cena explained to Van Vliet how he returned to action so quickly which says a lot about how he puts on so much muscle. The secret to Cena's physique is that he works harder than everyone else and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">will even exercise more than once a day</a> when his schedule allows.</p><p>"They have to put a realistic timeline on their work and that timeline is based on the construct that you do physical therapy three times a week. I would do physical therapy three times a day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrCmusBmm56mmZqxbr%2FTnqmooZRiv7a5zquqZq%2Bfp7iwwdNmqaitpJ67pns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-cena-denied-steroid-rumors-workout-routine.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leo-hijazi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leo-hijazi.html>Leo Hijazi - Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Facts, Net Worth, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jamie-cail-boyfriend-who-is-kamal-six-pack-thomas.html>Jamie Cail Boyfriend; Who is Kamal Six Pack Thomas ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jamie-cail-boyfriend-who-is-kamal-six-pack-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
