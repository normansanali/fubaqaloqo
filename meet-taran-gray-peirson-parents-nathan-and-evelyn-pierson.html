Taran, here, loves them and they also feel the same way or even more about him. And Taran often mentioned them on his social media. For instance, this one time in 2017, he shared how his parents gave him this toy of a 1961 Trailways Bus for his birthday. This was the same year model that the Freedom Riders rode. Taran shared that he places it on his desk as a reminder that there is deep support from his family that is always pushing him forward.</p><p>Taran also often says things like that his parents have supported him with prayer, love, and blessings.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Taran Gray Peirson’s Father, Nathan Peirson</strong></h3><p>Taran Gray Pierson’s father Nathan R.

She lived in Southern California her entire life. Also, she was a graduate of BIOLA College; was married to the late Ernest R. Peirson; was a Director of Social Services and then Director of Hospice at Corona Community Hospital; and in her retirement, she served as secretary and personal assistant for her brother, Robert L. Vernon.</p><p>Other than Taran, she and her husband also welcomed Levi Peirson, Timothy W.
