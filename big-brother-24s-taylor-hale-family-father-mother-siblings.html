You know she was hated by many of her fellow contestants at the start of the show and she even broke down in tears. But after all the trials and tribulation, she saw it through to the end and won (8-1 vote), the sweet revenge of success.</p><p>Speaking with Parade, Taylor shared that she had never expected to win. “Monte has very, very strong connections with this jury. It looked like it was his jury up and down,” she said. Even though she won the game with eight of the nine jurors voting in her favor, she wasn’t the only one who was taken aback by the results.</p><p>“Indy says, ‘I’m voting for my favorite person.’ And I literally pat Monte on the back,” Taylor said.</p><p>In her post-game interview, Taylor acknowledged that Monte played “a very true, honest game,” and she had predicted that his performance would be “respected&nbsp;more.” Although many people praised Monte’s strategy, Taylor ultimately won because of her personal story and closing remarks to the jury.</p><p>Taylor added that “Perseverance and resiliency is also a way to win this game.” Not only did she use this strategy to win the game, but she also used it to win America’s Favorite Player (AFP), which increased her $750,000 grand prize by an additional $50,000, making her the highest-paid Big Brother winner of all time.</p><p>Currently over the moon besides Taylor is her family members.
