Back in 2022, Tyneesha Rivers talked to Essence.com, about raising Mikal as a single mother and guiding her son to NBA stardom. Tyneeha still clearly recalls the day she called her parents to inform them of her pregnancy over 26 years ago. The young college student, who was 19 at the time, was afraid.</p><p>“The level of disappointment my parents had was almost crippling because they wanted more for me,” Tyneeha told Essence. “They did not want me to be just another statistic—another young Black girl from the city.”</p><p>Tyneeha viewed her pregnancy as a blessing according to the outlet. Additionally, she understood that it would pose a challenge for her goal to graduate from college. That would disappoint her family.</p><p>“I remember it like it was yesterday,” Tyneeha started. “Being the Marine that he was, very stern…and I get choked up every time I tell his story because he literally said to me,&nbsp;‘this is on you,’” Tyneeha reflected on the time about sharing about her pregnancy with her father.</p><p>Tyneeha welcomed Mikal Bridges in the summer of 1996 and immediately jumped back into work and school. Born on 30 August 1996, Mikal is currently 26 years old. His father is reportedly named Jack Bridges. He currently plays for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a professional basketball player from the United States. He participated in collegiate basketball with the Villanova Wildcats, who won the 2016 and 2018 national titles.</p><p>Mikal was chosen by the Philadelphia 76ers as the tenth overall choice in the 2018 NBA draft before being traded to the Phoenix Suns on draft night, where he was a member of the squad that made it to the NBA Finals in 2021. Bridges, also known as “The Warden,” has never missed a game in his NBA career since being drafted, and he now holds the record for the most straight games played.</p><h3><strong>Is Tyneeha Rivers Married?</strong></h3><p>Tyneeha Rivers is not married at the time of this writing. But she has discussed her dating life while appearing in Ep.2 of <a href=#>Tipping The Scales</a> with Shea Dawson. One of the dating stories she shared was from 2021 when she went on a date and showed up 15 minutes late.</p><p>Meanwhile, her partner was drunk already when she arrived. They sat down and he started talking about his ex-wife and told a story about how she took their daughter and all of his money while banging on the table. She couldn’t take it anymore so she walked to the bathroom grabbed her jacket and walked away.</p><p>From that incident on, Tyneeha swore to herself that she wasn’t doing online dating anymore.</p><p>Additionally, she discussed having standards when it comes to dating because she doesn’t want to bring anyone home just anyone. Furthermore, Tyneeha also talked about dating challenges and one that she pointed out on the show was where she was going to find people because she spends most of her time at work or trying to attend Mikal’s game.</p><h3><strong>Tyneeha Rivers Age</strong></h3><p>Born in October 1977, Tyneeha Rivers is 45 years old.</p><h3><strong>Tyneeha Rivers Job</strong></h3><p>Tyneeha Rivers is currently employed as Chief People Officer at Curaleaf since April 2022.
