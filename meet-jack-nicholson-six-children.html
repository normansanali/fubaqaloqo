While Susan publicly contended that Jack was the father of Caleb, the actor claimed he wasn't convinced. Susan went on to marry actor Mark Goddard, who adopted Caleb, but the son went on to insist in 1996 that Jack had privately recognized his paternity.</p><p id=eF38fNzzpu1 data-wc=49>In 1998, Jack confirmed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Rolling Stone</a> that he and Caleb were "getting along beautifully now", before caveating that "based on the legality - the extremely unpleasant litigious nature of most of my relationship there - I’m not really at liberty to say what I think about it."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Honey Hollman, 43</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0298981957f5-gettyimages-159142931.jpg><p id=eRwhkZSiyY4 data-wc=31>In the midst of Jack's 17-year relationship with Anjelica Huston, the actor reportedly had a relationship with Danish model Winnie Hollman, who gave birth to daughter Honey on January 26, 1982.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKoXn-epcSv data-wc=23>Jack has never publicly recognized Honey as his own, and not much is known about her as Winnie raised her back in Denmark.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Lorraine Nicholson, 33</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ace82aaa454-gettyimages-99983960.jpg><p id=eZvCxC1KOae data-wc=33>Lorraine is Jack's daughter from his relationship with actress Rebecca Broussard, born April 16, 1990.

I've asked more unanswered questions to these two particular children."</p><p id=e0Ej1S3lxd5u data-wc=73>He added: "Then you think, 'Hey, I did not want to hang out with my parents when I was a teenager.' You have to get over that as a parent. What I don't want to pass along is my irrational fears. They can be perfect kids, they can try to do everything right — and you're in the lap of the gods. This is the eternal vulnerability that you have with your children."</p><p id=e0LH0y4EyEiM data-wc=30>Lorrain went on to attend Brown University and has since pursued a career in film, with her directorial debut, short film , debuting at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Ray Nicholson, 32</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6e8e18f3ff1-gettyimages-1254337087.jpg><p id=eNgc0xtEGWU5 data-wc=39><a class=hm-link href=#>Jack's youngest son, Ray</a>, was born to Rebecca on February 20, 1992.
