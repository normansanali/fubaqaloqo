Jeff Francoeur</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jeff Francoeur burst onto the scene with the Atlanta Braves and was hailed as a future superstar.&nbsp;But his career was marred by inconsistency and an inability to adapt to major league pitching, leading to a decline from his early success.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Billy Beane</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Billy Beane was the 23rd overall pick in the 1980 MLB draft by the New York Mets.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>He was expected to be a power-hitting outfielder but struggled to find his groove in the majors, ultimately transitioning to a front office role where he found success as a pioneering executive in baseball analytics.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Overall, the history of Major League Baseball is littered with instances of highly touted prospects and big-name signings failing to meet expectations.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Whether due to injuries, personal issues, or an inability to translate talent into on-field success, these players serve as a reminder of the unpredictability of professional sports.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While they may not have achieved the greatness that was once predicted for them, their stories provide valuable lessons for both players and teams in the ever-evolving world of baseball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqbyxeZBpZKakkmKvtr%2FTrGSipl2dtrTAzquw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-mlb-busts-in-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./we-are-never-letting-go-of-these-victorias-secret-perfumes-and-heres-why.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./we-are-never-letting-go-of-these-victorias-secret-perfumes-and-heres-why.html>We Are Never Letting Go Of These Victorias Secret Perfumes, And Heres Why</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./black-jeopardy-saturday-night-live-oral-history-html.html>The Sketch That Always Plays Hot</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./black-jeopardy-saturday-night-live-oral-history-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
