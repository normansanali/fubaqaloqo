Depending on the cut and material, you can wear a good pair of leggings everywhere from the dentist’s office to the dance floor, something that makes investing in a good pair well worth the price. More and more companies are getting into the legging game, too, trying new fabrics, pocket placements, waistband thicknesses, and lengths.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So how do you know what the best pair is for any given occasion? And beyond that, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>if you’re plus-sized</a>, how do you know what brands even make leggings in a full range of sizes, since — sadly — precious few actually do?

A self-described “apple shape,” she loves the thick waistband, which she says never rolls down. The Powervita fabric is light and breathable, and Diaz-Herrera says she can wear them all day “without feeling like, ‘Oh my god. It’s too much.’” She also loves that they have pockets, because who doesn’t love pockets? “I actually had a pair of Nikes that I loved but then I realized that, ‘oh my god, these don’t have pockets,’” she says. “I loved how luxurious they felt, but I just can’t do it.” For length, shoppers have their choice between three — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">capri</a>, <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">7/8</a>, and full — in three sizing categories — regular, petite, and tall.

What makes Vitality’s Cloud II pant stand apart, though, is its four-way stretch fit, its flattering rear seam, and its marshmallow-soft fabric. The brand calls them “squat proof,” meaning the waistband won’t roll and the butt doesn’t turn sheer, no matter how tight they are. They’re also sweat-wicking and antimicrobial, meaning they won’t get too stinky or damp, even after a hard sesh at the gym.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2XS–4XL | <strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise | <strong>Available Length: </strong>Regular, short, and long | <strong>Colors: </strong>16</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-the-gym-people-thick-high-waisted-yoga-pants-with-pockets></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>THE GYM PEOPLE Thick High-Waisted Yoga Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="THE GYM PEOPLE Thick High Waist Yoga Pants with Pockets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BoaXShYM-UxiMfkSIsjCTRGN3vw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-gym-people-thick-high-waist-yoga-pants-with-pockets-tummy-control-workout-running-yoga-leggings-for-women-5b49cb5827e941b4bb0eb82cb1912f7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These leggings are affordable, durable, and have pockets.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re fast fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a quick and easy purchase, Amazon has a respectable selection of plus-size leggings.

If you’re just looking for a bargain pair of leggings, you can’t go wrong with Leggings Depot’s high-waisted leggings. With over 20,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, these leggings are a crowd-pleaser, even if the construction is maybe not what you’d get if you were willing to fork over a little more. These might not last you the next 10 years, but if you’re looking for a perfectly solid way to fill a quick need, these will get the job done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–5X | <strong>Fit: </strong>High-rise | <strong>Available Length: </strong>Capri, full | <strong>Colors: </strong>39</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-just-my-size-plus-size-stretch-jersey-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Just My Size Plus-Size Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Just My Size Plus-Size Stretch Jersey Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i9r8WK_EnSdctq_t1GuUS_Qft8I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Just-My-Size-Plus-Size-Stretch-Jersey-Legging-14ccea836543465fa961e13c4b7c9cd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Breezy cotton lets your lady parts breathe.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re only available in black and gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Produced by the cotton-loving people at Hanes, these Just My Size leggings are almost entirely made of breathable jersey, for those days when your body just needs a break from stretchy nylon and spandex. A comfortable, wide waistband keeps the top of the leggings in place, while flatlock seams keep chafing at bay. The ankle-length cut is flattering and cute, especially when paired with low socks and a nice clean pair of tennis shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1X–5X | <strong>Fit: </strong>High-waisted | <strong>Available Length: </strong>Ankle | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flared-the-giving-movement-flared-softskin100-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flared</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Giving Movement Flared Softskin100 Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Giving Movement Flared Softskin100 Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PpIMcZvtgZSyK8iZJslfAVvA7uQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Giving-Movement-Flared-Softskin100-Leggings-e7c1f3e2f2664bbfa9044a0496517e6a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Giving Movement</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The flare on these is perfect: Noticeable enough so that it looks cool but subtle enough that it doesn’t feel like you’re wearing your mom’s old bell bottoms.<strong><br>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no pockets.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A sleek and stylish legging that gives just a bit of a kick out around your ankle, The Giving Movement’s flared Softskin 100 legging is perfect for low-impact workouts, bopping around the mall, and hanging out at home.

The leggings’ tummy control panel is designed to make wearers look slimmer and more streamlined, while also helping that waistband stay firmly in place.

They’re easy to get on, don’t get too sweaty no matter how long you wear them, and offer plenty of stretch for when you want to get your groove on with Danny Zuko at the big carnival.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1X–3X | <strong>Fit: </strong>Mid-rise with back pockets | <strong>Available Length: </strong>Full | <strong>Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for leggings, think about the fabric’s stretch and durability. Terez founder Zara Terez Tisch says that for her company, fabric is of the utmost importance not just because they want to pick out stuff that looks cute, but because “you want your fabric to have the qualities that bring ease to the fact that you chose to wear leggings.” As she explains, “You want comfort, breathability, and compressions in areas so you feel like you’re getting a nice hug.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You also want a fabric that can mold or stretch to fit your specific body — whether you’re apple-shaped, pear-shaped, or straight up and down. Some fabrics have more give than others, so choosing something with a four-way stretch is always a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to think about a piece of fabric’s recovery time, with Sanctuary's co-founder Debra Polanco telling us that it’s important to not just think about how a pair of leggings looks the first time it goes on but to test or consider how it’ll last over time. No one wants a baggy bottom or a stretched-out waistband — especially on a pair of leggings.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When thinking about what leggings to buy, consider your body first and foremost. What size are you? What shape? Is your torso long, or do you have legs for days? Unlike a lot of other pants, leggings often come in a wide range of cuts, lengths, and fits, meaning you’ll hopefully be able to get a pair that really fits how you’d like.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re on the shorter side, that means opting for either a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">crop</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">7/8</a> length, which 5-foot, 1-inch tall Diaz-Herrera says works like a full-length pant for her. “I want to make sure my leggings don’t bunch at the bottom,” she says, adding that as someone with an “apple shape,” she’s also always looking for a thicker waistband. “Someone with a pear shape wouldn’t have as much of a problem holding up leggings, but for someone my size, thinking about that can be useful,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Function</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are your new leggings for lazy Sundays on the couch or are they for your upcoming months of marathon training? Know what you’re buying for and purchase accordingly. “More compressive leggings are better for runners because they’ll hold up during a long run and typically they won’t slide down as much,” says Laura Berens, founder and CEO of Love & Fit. “Stretchier leggings are great for casual outings or yoga.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of your compression level, Berens says buyers should always look for “great reinforced stitching on the pockets and seams, moisture-wicking fabric, and something that is easy for you to wash and dry.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should I wash my leggings?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That depends on what you’re wearing them for. If you wore your favorite pair to the gym, then you’re going to want to wash them shortly thereafter, even if they’re not that stinky. Since they fit so close to the body, they often absorb germs and bits of sweat and skin, so it’s always worth giving them a spin in the washer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re just wearing leggings on a plane, though, you might be good to wear them again, provided they didn’t get stained or soaked. That’s helpful for packing too: You can get twice as much wear out of the same pair of pants, saving you precious suitcase space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you wash your leggings, Berens says that hang drying will increase most pairs’ longevity, though you could also tumble dry them on low. Most importantly, she says, is to, “make sure you are not washing them with Velcro, jeans, or anything that would snag them.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What’s the difference between capri, 7/8, and full lengths, and when would I want to wear each one?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s entirely based on personal preference.
