<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Best known as Stephanie in the sitcom Melissa & Joey, Lucy Devito is an American actress. Nearly in her 40, she still looks young and fresh to audiences, becoming one desirable lady. Hence, the interest in her dating life and her romantic inclination is huge.</p><p>Her first significant screen appearance was in the 2009 film Leaves of Grass; later that year, DeVito co-starred with her mother in the Westside Theatre’s off-Broadway production of Nora and Delia Ephron’s Love, Loss, and What I Wore.</p><p>In the 2016 movie The Comedian, she played the character’s daughter, played by Danny DeVito.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-lucy-devito-married-danny-devitos-daughter-and-her-boyfriend></span>Is Lucy Devito Married? Danny Devito’s Daughter And Her Boyfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Probably Lucy Devito comes off as one of the most private celebrities when it comes to discussing her love life in the media. In over two decades of her career, neither has the actress been linked to anyone nor has her affairs been discussed.</p><p>Coming to her wedding rumors, no, Lucy Devito is not married. She does not have a husband or a boyfriend.</p><p>The daughter of actors Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, DeVito was born on March 11, 1983, in Los Angeles. &nbsp;Grace Fan DeVito, a sister, and Jacob Daniel DeVito, a brother, are her two younger siblings. Her mother is Jewish, and her father is a Catholic.</p><p>Her father, an American actor, comedian, and director Daniel DeVito Jr rose to fame by playing the taxi dispatcher Louie De Palma in the television series Taxi, for which he was honored with both a Golden Globe and an Emmy. In the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, he plays Frank Reynolds.</p><p>On the other hand, her mother was also an American actress. In the sitcom Cheers, she portrayed Carla Tortelli, the head waitress. Over the course of 11 seasons, Perlman received seven Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, set a record, and was nominated for ten Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress (winning four times).</p><p>Additionally, she has acted in movies, including Canadian Bacon (1995), Matilda (1996), The Sessions (2012), and Poms (2019).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lucy-devito-dating-history-explored></span>Lucy Devito Dating History Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many sites on the web claim that Lucy was at least in one relationship before, but now she is completely single. As mentioned above, she has been extremely private about her love life. Hence, there is very little known as well.</p><p>In her career-defining shows, Melissa and Joey, her character, Stephanie Krause, had a huge crush on the show’s lead, Joe. However, things did not work out for the two of them as he was meant to be with the other lead Mel.</p><p>Joey Lawrence and Lucy Devito have a good onscreen wrap-up. However, he recently got married to Samantha Cope.</p><p>Talking about their character on the show, beginning with episode 7, Stephanie Krause served as Mel’s legislative assistant and former intern. Stephanie is a hyperactive and highly devoted person who is eager to arrange interviews, picture ops, and media publicity for Mel. She frequently shows signs of having a crush on Joe.</p><p>On the other hand, he is a former CEO and commodities trader with an MBA who, as a result of Mel’s brother-in-Ponzi law’s scam, lost his career, his money, and his marriage and ended up living in his car.</p><p>He decided to be the live-in nanny/house manager because he saw Mel needed help raising her niece and nephew, and he wanted to help Mel and the kids. He and Mel got together in “A Decent Proposal.” In “Right time, right place,” he proposed to her, and in “At last,” they were married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYrGius2yZJ2dpp7BsHnDmqygoKSav2641JywZpyVq7a1u4ymmKuqmZqxbrXNZmlpamJitaa%2BjJ2YraGenHqttcWeZJ6woKG8s7HDaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-danny-devito-daughter-lucy-devito-married-in-2022-her-dating-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-lamelo-ball-gay-sexuality-rumors-and-children-revealed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-lamelo-ball-gay-sexuality-rumors-and-children-revealed.html>Is LaMelo Ball Gay?
