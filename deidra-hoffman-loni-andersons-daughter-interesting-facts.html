Her mother is a Golden Globe winner best remembered for her roles in WKRP in Cincinnati, A Night at the Roxbury, Stroker Ace, and 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain.</strong></p><p>Deidra, like her mother, tried her hand in the movie industry as a teenager, but the star child was uncredited for her performance. So, aside from a media appearance alongside her famous mother, Hoffman never appeared in any other acting projects and chose to avoid the media circus.</p><p>So, where is Deidra Hoffman these days? Hoffman is he married? If she has a husband, who is he? To answer all of these questions, today’s piece will delve into more details concerning Loni Anderson’s daughter Deidra. Stick with us until the finish to learn more in depth.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Hoffman8217s_Father_Her_Childhood_and_Parents>Deidra Hoffman’s Father. Her Childhood and Parents</span></h2><p>Deidra, Loni Anderson’s sole biological daughter, is 58 years old in 2023. Deidra Kaye Hasselberg, the celebrity child, was born in the United States on March 13, 1965. Her mother, Loni Anderson, is an actress, and her father, Bruce Hasselberg, is a real estate dealer, as we all know.</p><p>Hoffman’s parents divorced when she was a year old. As a result, it is clear that she does not have a proper family atmosphere. Her mother raised her on her own in her hometown.</p><p>Furthermore, she is of mixed ethnicity because her father is Caucasian and her mother is of Swedish, Norwegian, German, English, and Scottish descent. Hoffman is also of American nationality.</p><h2><span id=Deidra8217s_Family_History>Deidra’s Family History</span></h2><p>Moving on, her paternal grandfather, Donald Hasselberg, is a former mayor of Bloomington, Minnesota. Similarly, Deidra’s paternal grandmother was pianist Phyllis M. Hasselberg, who worked in the Southdale Dayton Music Department.</p><p>Similarly, Hoffman’s grandfather Klaydon Carl “Andy” Anderson was an environmental chemist on her mother’s side. Maxine Hazel, her grandmother, was a model.</p><h2><span id=sWhat_About_Deidra8217s_Father_Deidra8217s_Mother_Married_Four_Times_During_Her_Life_What_About_Her_Father>sWhat About Deidra’s Father? Deidra’s Mother Married Four Times During Her Life: What About Her Father?</span></h2><p>Hoffman’s parents divorced when she was just a year old, as previously stated. Both ex-couples remarried after their divorces.</p><p>Bruce, her father, remarried twice. Following his divorce from Loni, he married an unknown woman, with whom he allegedly has a son named James Hasselberg. His second marriage was also short-lived. Later, he married Barbara Ann Howard, with whom he was married until Barbara’s death on September 22, 2013.</p><p>Loni’s mother, like her father, remarried. Loni married three times after divorcing her first husband (Deidra’s father). Her second marriage was to actor Ross Bickell, and their union ended in divorce.</p><p>The Mullets actress later married Burt Reynolds, with whom she had their adopted son Quinton Anderson Reynolds. After five years, she filed for divorce from her Stroker Ace co-star. She is currently happily married to Bob Flick.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Hoffman_Has_Appeared_In_A_Few_TV_Series_What_Else_Does_She_Do>Deidra Hoffman Has Appeared In A Few TV Series; What Else Does She Do?</span></h2><p>Deidra, like her mother, dabbled in the television profession. She made her acting debut at the age of 15 in the television film The Jayne Mansfield Story. Her first film, however, proved her final as an actress.</p><p>Later that year, as a self, Hoffman appeared in the documentary series Intimate Portrait. After a 15-year hiatus, she reappeared in an episode of the American talk show The Doctors. What else she does besides being on television is unknown.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Hoffman_Is_a_Happy_Wife_Who_Is_Her_Husband>Deidra Hoffman Is a Happy Wife; Who Is Her Husband?</span></h2><p>The Minnesota native is married to Chris Hoffman, who is said to be an actress. Despite receiving extensive media coverage as a celebrity child, Deidra has wisely kept her personal life private. As a result, no information about her wedding plans is available.</p><p>However, the couple is secretly enjoying a happy marriage. According to Deidra’s Facebook page, the husband and wife clearly adore each other. They were there for each other through thick and thin.</p><h2><span id=Hoffman_is_a_mother_of_two_sons>Hoffman is a mother of two sons.</span></h2><p>Deidra Hoffman is the mother of two lovely kids, McKenzie Hoffman and Megan Hoffman, from her marriage to her adored husband. While her daughter’s exact birth date is unknown, it appears that they were twins.</p><p>Megan Hoffman, Hoffman’s daughter, posted a photo of herself and her sister McKenzie on Facebook on December 22, 2017, with the message,</p><p>So, Santa, whatever song did I sing to you on our birthday this year?</p><p>According to the caption, both of Hoffman’s children celebrated their birthdays on the same day.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Fought_Serious_Illness_in_2009_What_Became_of_Loni_Anderson8217s_Daughter>Deidra Fought Serious Illness in 2009; What Became of Loni Anderson’s Daughter?</span></h2><p>Loni Anderson’s daughter was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2009. She first experienced numb fingers one day and tingling in her spine the next. Deidra was later diagnosed with MS after undergoing an MRI procedure in 2009.</p><p>Meanwhile, her biggest fan became her actress mother. Loni once stated about Hoffman’s battle with multiple sclerosis,</p><p>“I fell apart,” I mean, “I didn’t want to fall apart in front of her because I knew she was struggling just to keep herself together, but it was very difficult to accept.”</p><p>Loni also mentioned that her eldest child struggled with minor tasks such as eating and sleeping. It’s evident that her treatment affected her adolescent girls and husband, but her mother stuck at her side through every test and MRI session, making it easier for Deidra to fight her condition.</p><p>Despite the fact that her sickness recurred multiple times, Anderson’s sole biological kid appears to have won her battle against MS and is now living a healthy life.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Hoffman_Has_a_Social_Media_Account>Deidra Hoffman Has a Social Media Account.</span></h2><p>The former child actress has 657 friends on Facebook. She has largely shared images of her husband and children on Facebook. Her most recent post was in September 2021, when she shared photos of herself with her family and a UCLA booklet.</p><p>She is also on Twitter, where she has 23 followers.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Deidra8217s_current_location>What is Deidra’s current location?</span></h2><p>Diedra currently resides in Anderson, California with her family, according to her Facebook profile. Hoffman is currently in her late 50s, so she is most likely enjoying her retirement years.</p><h2><span id=Deidra_Hoffman8217s_Net_Worth>Deidra Hoffman’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>Her net worth is being scrutinized because her job is still a source of interest. However, according to some sources, her fortune is worth $1 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, her famous mother, Loni Anderson, is worth an estimated $12 million.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Daughter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bella Vita Bardot Boreanaz | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Bella Vita Bardot is the famous daughter of David Boreanaz and a juvenile equestrian.
