Saumensch is a combination of the German terms Sau and Mensch (= pig and human), and it is a general phrase that may be used to refer to both women and men (girl and boy). Saukerl is a little more difficult to translate. It is a mix of the terms Sau and Kerl (which mean pig and (male form of) man).
