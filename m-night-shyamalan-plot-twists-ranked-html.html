M. Night Shyamalan has made his career on the plot twist. Aside for a few notable exceptions, his body of work is full of gotcha moments, laboring heavily under their own ambitions, trying in vain to surprise a jaded audience, and, more often than not, failing miserably.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69d94cf900b9a30fad2a9782712dc7a9-2-0-2@published data-word-count=81>You go into a Shyamalan film waiting for the other shoe to drop. If the plot seems straightforward and easy to understand, hold onto your hat because two-thirds of the way through the thing, something you never saw coming is going to emerge from the shadows, hitting you over the head with how clever it is. It’s the movie equivalent of click bait: You fall for it hard the first time around, but every subsequent iteration leaves you queasy and irritated.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69d94cf900b9a30fad2a9782712dc7a9-2-0-3@published data-word-count=100>The surprise plot twist is Shyamalan’s calling card — winking, pedantic, self-serious, intending to teach the audience some larger moral lesson while also engaging their interest enough to stick around to see it come to fruition. In honor of <a href=#>his new movie <i>Split</i><i>,</i></a> we took a closer look at the twists throughout Shyamalan’s filmography. How twisty are these twists, really? Will anything live up to the standard set by <i>The Sixth Sense</i>? To keep things fair, we eliminated movies that he made that don’t include any kind of surprise ending, and ended up with this ranking from worst to best.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69d94cf900b9a30fad2a9782712dc7a9-3-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>8.

Only one girl survives, and I’m sure you won’t be able to figure out who it is from the first 15 minutes of the movie.

Science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) embark on a journey to figure this out. It turns out the enemy — plants! — is all around us.<b><br>The Twist: </b>Instead of bioterrorism or anything that makes a modicum of sense, the real enemy here is Mother Nature. The plants are the enemy. Kill the plants before they kill you.<b><br>How Twisted Is It? </b>Technically, the fact that the plants are emitting poison into the air with the intent of exacting revenge on humans <i>is</i> a surprise, but it is honestly one of the most hackneyed surprise endings that ever was.<b><br>Rating: </b>As twisty as thinking you found money in your winter coat before immediately realizing it’s just a crumpled ATM receipt.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69d94cf900b9a30fad2a9782712dc7a9-9-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>6.<a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=JmR8UY><i> Lady in the Water </i></a></b><b>(2006)</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-69d94cf900b9a30fad2a9782712dc7a9-11-0-0@published data-word-count=214><b>The Plot:</b> Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is a mopey handyman who discovers a Narf named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) living in the pool of the apartment complex where he works. It turns out Story is a mystical creature from a bedtime story sent to find the author of the book that will eventually save humanity. That person happens to be Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), the author of a book that contains ideas so transformative, they will inspire future leaders to change the world for better. Also, the residents of the apartment complex are actually part of Story’s story and at the end of the whole thing, she flies off to safety on the wings of a giant eagle.<b><br>The Twist:</b> Technically none, unless you count the fact that the marijuana-fueled ramblings of a self-important director that never should have left his dream journal got made into a film.<b><br>How Twisted Is It? </b>The plot is, quite frankly, insane. But as nonsensical and trite as it is, it’s pretty straightforward.

The Elders of the town, who keep their secrets locked in black boxes under their beds, forbid their children from speaking of the evil spirits and entering the forest at all costs. But after one of the villagers, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), is injured, the blind daughter of the chief village Elder (Bryce Dallas Howard) is permitted to seek help in “the towns” by passing through the forest, where she learns the secret of where she actually lives.<b><br>The Twist:</b> It’s not the 19th century, and the villagers are being held captive as part of some weird social experiment by the chief Elder, who’s actually an American history professor. The only “monster” that’s beyond the walls is modern society, huzzah!<br><b>How Twisted Is It?</b> Even a casual viewer of Shyamalan’s body of work could see this coming a mile away.

Samuel L. Jackson is Elijah, a shadowy figure cursed with fragile bird bones that shatter at any moment. As you can imagine, this does not end well.<b><br>The Twist:</b> David is (maybe) a superhero and Elijah is his arch-nemesis, a man who perpetrated terrible crimes — including the train accident that helped David realize what he was — in order to bring them together.<b><br>How Twisted Is It? </b>It’s<b> </b>less of a plot twist and more of a reveal that makes you sit back and go “…huh,” really.

This movie set the standard for what would become Shyamalan’s calling card — the surprise-ending gut-punch — and in the original iteration, truly caught people off guard.
