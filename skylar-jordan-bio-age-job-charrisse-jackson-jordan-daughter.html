Well, the then-freshman featured on </span><i><span>RHOP</span></i><span> alongside her mother has now graduated from </span><i><span>Spelman College</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>But that’s not the only thing you missed about her. Keep reading this Skylar Jordan Bio to learn everything about Charrisse’s daughter.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Skylar Jordan, RHOP Star Charrisse Jackson-Jordan Daughter</b></h3><p><span>Skylar Jordan and her mother Charrisse Jackson-Jordan are more friends than mom-daughter.</span></p><p><span>According to Skylar, she even often forgot that her mother was not her age, and so did Charrisse. However, for the </span><i><span>RHOP</span></i><span> star forgetting her age was international.</span></p><p><span>Wishing Skylar the best and confessing her wish to be young (prior to Skylar’s graduation day), Charrisse wrote on IG, “Can’t believe my baby and our besties (okay her besties- I’m always trying to be young 😂) are graduating next month.”</span></p><p><span>If you’ve been a long-time fan of </span><i><span>Real Housewives of Potomac</span></i><span> then you should know that Skylar joined </span><i><span>Spelman College</span></i><span> back in 2018. She was featured being dropped off by her mother at the college then.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, before Skylar headed back to Potomac, Charrisse made sure that her daughter’s dorm room was nothing short of perfect. A white, blush, and gold color schemed dorm room even had a pair of super fluffy-looking slippers to match Skylar’s blush accent pillow and rug.</span></p><p><span>But this wasn’t the first time Charrisse spoiled her daughter. The RHOP star taking Skylar on dates and buying her the clothes she desired is nothing new to viewers.</span></p><p><span>To summarize, Charrisse loved Skylar to the moon. She was there to drop Skylar off at school and was there when she graduated. “I am probably the proudest mother alive to have a daughter that is so caring, intelligent, spiritual, has high standards and ambitions, and is overall a good person that makes loving her so easy,” the RHOP star praised her daughter on her graduation day.</span></p><h3><b>Does Skylar Jordan Have A Sibling?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Skylar Jordan has two older siblings named Jackson (Skylar’s firstborn, birthday: March 21) and Justin.</span></p><p><span>Her brother, Jackson was a basketball athlete who played for </span><i><span>Southern New Hampshire University</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, Jackson was often the star of Skylar’s socials. From dancing and lipsyncing on TikTok videos to FB appreciation posts, Jackson has graced his sister’s socials.</span></p><p><span>Here’s his IG @</span><a href=#><span>jacksonvljordan</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for Skylar’s father, he is Eddie Jordan, a former basketball player for </span><i><span>Rutgers</span></i><span> (1973-1977).</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Skylar’s parents divorced in 2017 — after 20 years of togetherness. Why? Well, Eddie made it clear that if Charrisse was going to join </span><i><span>Real Housewives of Potomac</span></i><span>, they would get a divorce. And Charrisse did!</span></p><p><span>“Needless to say, I took that as my marriage was done. So, I said, well, I might as well do the show,” the star explained her decision.</span></p><h3><b>Skylar Jordan Age</b></h3><p><span>Skylar Jordan was 22 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>This means Charrisse had her when she was 35.</span></p><h3><b>Skylar Jordan Job</b></h3><p><span>Skylar Jordan is a future dermatologist. Though she might have just graduated from </span><i><span>Spelman College</span></i><span> (with an undergraduate research assistant degree) now, someday she hopes to become a skin doctor who “caters to and researches black/ melanated skin.”</span></p><p><span>Also, working on her career, Skylar has already presented her findings at research conferences regionally and nationally.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, she has also started an IG skincare blog @</span><a href=#><span>skinbysv</span></a><span> where she shared and explained the proven information she discovered in a simplified way. She claimed that her findings didn’t “scare people away from skincare (since it can become overwhelming) and also highlight the differences in skincare practices for people of color.”</span></p><p><span>Here is the list of the jobs Skylar embarked upon before pursuing her career in dermatology — “product specialist” at Lululemon (from Oct 2020 – Feb 2021), “student shadow” at</span><i><span> DuPont Aesthetic Institute</span></i><span> (from June – August 2019) where she was able to interact with Dr. Dupont’s patients as well as view procedures if the patient consented, and as a night-shift mall employee (2020).</span></p><p><span>In her free time, Skylar loves shopping, making TikToks, visiting museums, and baking. Surprisingly, she’s an amazing baker as well.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Skylar was part of the “Student of the Year” campaign in 2018 through the </span><i><span>Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Is Skylar Jordan On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of September 2022, find Skylar on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>skylarvictoriaa</span></a><span> with 4.9K followers.
