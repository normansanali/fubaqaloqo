So, in this writing let us tell you who Jamal Murray’s girlfriend is.</p><h3><strong>Meet Harper Hempel, Jamal Murray’s Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Jamal Murray just recently admitted to being “better than a lot of players” in his league. When it comes to his dating life though, he has not once candidly spoken in public. Those who have followed his career, also have been aware of his tendency of never reporting anything in the media.</p><p>Even on social media, despite having thousands of followers (Jamal has a million) on social media, even there they have kept rather meticulously-maintained profiles. Neither of them gave anything away, making it rather tough to confirm whether or not they are still dating. Yet, a TikTok video made by Harper consisting of a “new chapter of independence” back in November 2022 had been considered a development in her dating circumstances with Jamal. The two have been rumored as a couple at least since 2020.</p><p>As for Jamal, he fell victim to leaks during the beginning of the first covid-19 lockdown. Explicit content was posted to his Instagram story in what seemed to be a hacking incident. According to reports, Harper, who was confirmed to be in a relationship with Jamal at the time, appealed for the hacker to delete the footage. However, the account she tweeted the plea from has not been in existence since.</p><h3><strong>Harper Hempel Age</strong></h3><p>Because Harper Hempel was born in 1996, she reached the age of 26 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Harper Hempel Family</strong></h3><p>Harper’s father is Richard “Rich” Lee Hempel, a Georgetown, Kentucky born and bred now reading in Union, Kentucky.
