She counts journalist Maria Menounos among her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity clientele</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Danielle MacKinnon, from Maine, claims she can communicate with pets after they’ve died. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She says she’s had the gift from a young age. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><p>“The animals were telling me to leave the job,” MacKinnon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told South West News Service</a>.</p><p>“It was scary,” she continued. “I was afraid.”</p><p>As for Bella, the psychic reportedly told MacKinnon and her husband, Kevin, 52, that their dog was telling him she was upset and had eaten corncobs because of this — something MacKinnon found to be true.</p><p>“He looked back and forth between me and my dog and my husband for a while, and then he finally said, ‘Well, she’s sick because she’s upset and because she was upset, she ate corncobs. And the reason she’s upset is because you and your husband have been fighting about your mother,'” MacKinnon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Cosmopolitan</a> in 2015.</p><p>She said she trained with Bella’s psychic shortly after that experience in 2000.</p><p>MacKinnon began to perform her own readings for pet owners, claiming she only needs the name of the pet to be able to connect with its spirit.</p><p>She explained that she has always felt very connected to animals, ever since she was young. She felt like she knew what the animals were “thinking.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">All she needs is a name to be able to communicate with pets in the afterlife, she told SWNS. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><p>“A lot of people ask to reconnect with their pet when they pass over,” she revealed to SWNS.</p><p>“The messages animals like to give to humans are like — ‘I saw you the other day working in a blue top.'”</p><p>She said they talk about people to “show they are still around.”</p><p>She noted that pets are very intuitive with human emotions and know when we’re not sharing everything with them.</p><p>“They tune into our emotions all the time,” MacKinnon argued. “They are so psychic — even when we try and hide it.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The 51-year-old has also taken her talents to social media, sharing videos about her readings. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><p>The pet communicator has quite the following on social media — with over 180,000 followers on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> TikTok </a>and 12,400 on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram.</a></p><p>She often explores topics such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what pets think when we are too busy for them.</a></p><p>In a recently reposted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram reel</a>, she said the No. 1 message she gets from pets on the other side is to pay attention.</p><p>“There’s one thing that they almost always say,” MacKinnon explained in the clip. “And that one thing that they almost always say is not, ‘I love you,’ it is not, ‘Don’t forget to take the trash out,’ it is not, ‘Hey, I’m mad at you because of how I crossed over.'”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She decided to tap into her gift after she and her husband, Kevin, saw a pet psychic themselves. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><p>“The one message that they usually have is, ‘Hey, I’m here, I’m around you, pay attention because I’m sending you messages,'” she added.</p><p>She also shared why our pets <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">follow us into the bathroom</a> sometimes.</p><p>“It’s not because they’re insecure, although they might be insecure,” she reasoned. “It’s not because they’re trying to annoy you, although they might be annoying you.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s actually because they’re reading your energy and intuitively, they’re checking in all the time, and when you’re on the toilet, your energy calms right down, you’re in the present moment and you’re a pleasure to be around.”</p><p>MacKinnon has published books about her observations, including one last month called <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>“The Incredible Animal Afterlife: What Your Pet Wants You to Know.”</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She has written books about her work. <span class=credit>Danielle MacKinnon / SWNS</span></figure><p>And, according to SWNS, MacKinnon has one very important piece of advice for owners — their pets “love everybody.”</p><p>“It’s not based on how many hugs you give them, or treats you give them,” she explained about the “unconditional love.”</p><p>“It’s based on their intuitive connection to you because they can feel the love in your heart.”</p><p class=postsid
