He went to Barnard Elementary School, Carver Middle School, and then Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, where he was a star in football, basketball, and track and field. He helped the Booker T. Washington Hornets win football and basketball titles from the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA). As a sophomore, he helped the team win the school’s first football OSSAA championship in 24 years. He did this in a number of important ways. Lockett played most of his junior year with a broken wrist that was first thought to be a bad sprain. He hurt his wrist in the second football game of the season, but he didn’t get a screw put in until after basketball season. In his senior year of football, Booker T. Washington went 13–1 and won the 2010 OSSAA 5A championship. Lockett played several positions in high school, and he was named All-State as a defensive back and Class 5A All-State as a wide receiver by the Oklahoma Coaches Association. Because he made All-State, he was asked to play in the state East-West All-Star game.</p><p>Lockett was also a top player in basketball and track, in addition to football. In basketball, his team made it to the state championship game, where Booker T. Washington beat El Reno High School 72–59 to win the 2011 OSSA 5A Championship. He was picked for the second-best team of the tournament. Lockett was one of the best sprinters in the state when it came to track and field. At the 2011 State 5A Regional, he won the 100-meter dash by running it in 10.85 seconds and coming in first. At the 5A state finals, he came in third in both the 100-meter dash (10.95 seconds) and the 200-meter dash (21.90 seconds).</p><p>Rivals.com gave Lockett three stars as a recruit, and ESPN.com ranked him as the 16th best player in Oklahoma and 170th best player in the country. He was ranked as the No. 115 cornerback in the country by Scout.com. Rivals.com said he was the 16th best high school football player in the state of Oklahoma in 2011. Scout.com said he was the 115th best cornerback in the country in 2011, and ESPN.com said he was the 170th best wide receiver. Kansas offered him a scholarship, but he chose Kansas State instead.</p><h2>Going to college</h2><p>Lockett got a sports scholarship to go to Kansas State University, where he played football from 2011 to 2014 for coach Bill Snyder’s Kansas State Wildcats. Kevin and Aaron, his father and uncle, both played wide receiver for the Wildcats when Snyder was the coach. Michael Smith is the coach of the Wildcats’ receivers. He has also worked with Lockett, his father, and his uncle.</p><h2>First year of school (2011)</h2><p>Lockett wanted to use his freshman year, 2011, as a redshirt so that he could get bigger. In 2011, he was a first-year player, and he didn’t do too well. In his first five games, through October 8, Lockett only had four catches for 50 yards, three runs for 9 yards, one kickoff return for 10 yards, and two punt returns for a total of 13 yards. On October 15, he returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown against Texas Tech. This was the first sign that things were getting better. Over the next few weeks, he got a lot of recognition from the Big 12 Conference for the 2011 team. For example, he was named Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week twice. On October 24, he was named Player of the Week for the first time after a 251-yard performance against Kansas in the Governor’s Cup on October 22. This performance included a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown and made him the first player in school history to return kickoffs for touchdowns in consecutive games. He also had a career-high five receptions and 110 yards receiving. On November 7, he was named Player of the Week again for a game against Oklahoma State on November 5 in which he returned a kickoff for 80 yards, ran three times for 84 yards, caught three passes for 32 yards, and scored a touchdown. This was his other Player of the Week award for that season. He didn’t play in Kansas State’s last three games of the regular season because he was hurt in a way that wasn’t clear at first. Later, it was found that the injury was a cut kidney. Before getting hurt, he had at least three receptions and 125 total yards in each of the four games he played.</p><p>He was the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year, a second-team All-Big 12 selection as a kickoff returner/punt returner, and an honorable mention as a wide receiver. He was a first-team All-American by Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation and a second-team All-American by CBS Sports and Sports Illustrated. Because of all of his honors, the NCAA called him a consensus All-American. He was also named an All-Freshman by Sporting News, Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), CBS Sports, Rivals.com (2nd team), and College Football News (honorable mention, WR). Lockett didn’t play in 75% of the Wildcats’ games, so he couldn’t be the leader in average kickoff return yards in the NCAA. Lockett averaged 35.19 yards per return (16 returns for 563 yards), but Raheem Mostert of Purdue led the NCAA in this category with an average of 33.48 yards per return.</p><h2>The second year (2012)</h2><p>The Big 12 media picked Lockett for the first team All-Big 12 as a kickoff returner before the season, but ESPN only put him on the honorable mention list and gave the first team spot to Oklahoma State’s Justin Gilbert. On September 15, Lockett scored his third career kickoff return touchdown against North Texas by returning a first-quarter kickoff 96 yards. On September 17, he was named Big 12 Conference Special Teams Player of the Week. On October 20, he set career highs in receptions (9), receiving yards (194), and receiving touchdowns (2) against West Virginia. This gave him the fifth highest single-game receiving yardage total in school history. On November 3, against Oklahoma State, Lockett scored on a kickoff return for the fourth time in his career. This earned him another Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week award. Lockett was named to the second team of Academic All-Big 12 on November 15. Lockett was an honorable mention for the All-Big 12 team in both wide receiver and special teams in 2012. He was also chosen by Sports Illustrated as an honorable mention All-American return specialist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWirsqSVp3qtu8KknK2sXZa7pXnWop2eZaSkeqOxjKWYrqqVo3qrrcKkqqimXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-abcs-the-muppets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-abcs-the-muppets.html>What Happened To ABC's 'The Muppets'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./trent-tomlinson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Trent Tomlinson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./trent-tomlinson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
