<time>16 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Julie Rouleau, Paul Rouleau’s wife</strong>, sent a $100 gift to federal Liberal leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy in 2006. There has been incorrect conjecture that Paul Rouleau is married to Suzette Trudeau. Paul Rouleau is a current judge of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Canada. He was formerly the commissioner of the Public Order Emergency Commission.</p><p>He headed the Inquisition into Emergencies Act, which was required by law to research and report on the Emergencies Act on February 14, 2022, during his term with the Public Order Emergency Commission. In 1983, he was also active in John Turner’s leadership campaign. After being admitted to the Bar in 1979, Justice Paul worked for the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell between 1979 and 1987.</p><p>Similarly, in 2005, the previous commissioner was appointed to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Furthermore, Paul stated on behalf of the commission in February 2023 that the conditions for activating the Emergencies Act had been satisfied.</p><h2>Who Is Suzette Trudeau, Paul Rouleau’s Wife?</h2><p><strong>Paul Rouleau</strong> is a married guy, but some have speculated that he is married to Suzette Trudeau, which is incorrect since he is married to Julie.&nbsp;Rouleau was never married to Suzette, and this is one of the most common misconceptions perpetuated by the internet. Suzette Trudeau, on the other hand, married Montreal dentist Pierre Rouleau.&nbsp;Suzette was born in 1918 and died in 2008 at the age of 89. According to the internet, Paul Rouleau and Pierre Rouleau were brothers who were the sons of a Federal Court of Canada judge called Paul C. Rouleau. Paul C died in 2007, leaving behind two kids with the same names as the people wrongfully accused. And Suzette was Paul’s sister-in-law and Pierre’s wife.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Paul-Rouleau-1.jpg alt="Paul Rouleau" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Paul Rouleau, the Justice, does not have a brother called Pierre; instead, his brothers, Jean and Guy, are also physicians in Montreal. So, Paul and Suzette were simply wrong about the assertion. It was, nevertheless, enmeshed in a web of perplexity.</p><h2>Paul Rouleau’s Wife and Children</h2><p><strong>Paul Rouleau</strong> made headlines when his name was connected to Suzette Trudeau. Justice Paul is married, however, Julie is his wife’s name.&nbsp;People were even more startled to learn about Paul’s married life since they had the same name. Paul is not more media-savvy, thus he has yet to tell us anything about his family and children.&nbsp;Similarly, he hasn’t discussed much about his married life, so we don’t know whether the couple has children, since he has prohibited the public from meddling in Paul’s private life.</p><p>Looking at his early life, Paul completed law school and served in the office of Liberal Prime Minister John Turner before pursuing a legal career. Similarly, Jacqueline, his aunt, married into the prominent Desmarais family. He was appointed to the Ontario Superior Court by then-Prime Minister Jean Chretien’s administration in 2002.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Paul-Rouleau-2.jpg alt="Paul Rouleau" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Paul Rouleau’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Paul Rouleau</strong> has been active in the sector from his early career, and he must have made a large number of money throughout his time in the court and other pertinent departments. The Judge, according to insiders, has a million-dollar net worth. Nonetheless, he has never publicly published details about his earnings and sources of revenue on websites.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp2kYr2iwctmqaitnJqutnnWop2eZaOqx6bA055kraqlmbKiwYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmnpGitq3Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-paul-rouleau-wife-suzette-trudeau-relationship-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./minal-khan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-221513-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./minal-khan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-221513-html.html>Minal Khan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./md-patrick-brophy-cause-and-death-how-did-doctor-die.html>MD Patrick Brophy Cause And Death: How Did Doctor Die?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./md-patrick-brophy-cause-and-death-how-did-doctor-die.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
