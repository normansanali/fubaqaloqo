<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Missouri has gained significant attention on social media after two of its female professors were found to have uploaded s3xual videos on OnlyFans. One of the professors, Brianna Coppage, who was responsible for teaching the school’s freshmen and sophomore English classes, reportedly resigned from her teaching position to focus solely on pornography after being suspended.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Another English instructor, Megan Gaither, was also found to have taken similar action a few days earlier. Gaither claims that the money she earns from her OnlyFans page helps to supplement her income as a teacher.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Who Is Megan Gaither?&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Megan Gaither is a 31-year-old English teacher who also serves as the varsity cheerleading coach at St. Clair High School. Recently, Gaither has gained media recognition due to her involvement in sharing explicit content on OnlyFans. According to reports, Gaither joined OnlyFans in May and has earned approximately $47,500, in addition to her income as a cheerleading coach.</p><p>However, following the revelation of her explicit side job, Gaither has informed reporters that she has been placed on leave. She said, “Teaching does not financially support a person. It’s really hard to stretch those paychecks during the summer. That’s why I did it,” she told the news outlet.</p><h2><b>Why Megan Gaither Joined OnlyFans&nbsp;</b></h2><p>In an effort to reduce her significant student loan debt of more than $125,000 and supplement her income as a teacher, Megan Gaither made the decision to join the OnlyFans platform. Gaither became a member of this exclusive website in May with the goal of using her earnings to help pay off her student loans. In the previous year, she earned a total of over $47,500, which included a coaching stipend.</p><p>Additionally, Gaither was able to generate an income ranging from $3,000 to $5,000 through her efforts on OnlyFans, and she gained approximately 1,500 subscribers. To maintain a balance between her professional and personal lives, she chose not to reveal her true identity. This approach worked well for her until recently, when she unintentionally appeared in a video shared on Coppage’s account, leading to rumors circulating among students.</p><p>The video was taken during a party in a hotel room in St. Louis, and although her face was not visible in it when a picture from the event surfaced online, she was reportedly wearing the same dress.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>What Next For Megan Gaither</strong></h2><p>After realizing that she would no longer pursue a teaching career, she opted to make her actions known to the public and emulate her closest companion’s approach by significantly increasing the balance in her bank account. Gaither said, “Right now, I am just hoping to make enough to support my family.” “In order to make change, you have to make noise, and I think that is what Brianna did.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She added, “And I think that’s what maybe I’m getting ready to do—make noise about how unfair teacher pay can be.” Currently, Gaither’s account has been restored. Before June, Gaither and Coppage, who are both respected English professors, were unaware that their lives were coinciding. Following Gaither’s casual remark at the “Teacher’s Night” event at Busch Stadium, their connection deepened. Gaither confirms that they are now the closest of friends.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdorKorc1mnpqhpJ2ys3nSnpqoppRiwaatwqGcq2WRqXqutdKspq6qmWK1qrPHZqqcoJ%2BkuW6vwK6eoaxdqLWivsinnmaZlKq5tXnCqKWtnZ6perC6jKilpbGWlru0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-megan-gaither-second-teacher-at-missouri-high-school-caught-sharing-adult-content-on-onlyfans.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./digitalstorm-slade-pro-workstation-pc-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./digitalstorm-slade-pro-workstation-pc-review.html>Workstation Performance - DigitalStorm Slade Pro Workstation PC Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-anesongib-and-whats-his-real-name.html>Who is AnEsonGib and what's his real name?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-anesongib-and-whats-his-real-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
