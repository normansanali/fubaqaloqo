He is an American football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League. Brady played for the New England Patriots for his first 20 seasons, where from 2001 to 2019 he played a crucial role in the team’s dynasty. Many people consider Brady to be the best quarterback to ever play the position. Brady was chosen by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, 199th overall, after playing college football at Michigan. He later gained the reputation of being the league’s biggest draft steal. During his second season, the Patriots won their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XXXVI, and he was named the starting quarterback.</p><p>Brady led the Patriots to seventeen division titles, including eleven straight from 2009 to 2019, 13 AFC Championship Games, including eight straight from 2011 to 2018, nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise. Brady served as the team’s primary starter for eighteen seasons. His individual achievements now stand at ten Super Bowl appearances and seven triumphs when he joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and guided them to Super Bowl LV victory. Nearly all of the important quarterback records, including passing yards, completions, touchdown passes, and games started, are held by Brady. He is the NFL leader in career quarterback victories, quarterback regular season victories, quarterback playoff victories, and&nbsp;Super Bowl MVP titles, and is the only Super Bowl MVP for two separate organizations. He has never had a losing season. Brady also holds records for the most selections to the Pro Bowl and the first unanimous NFL MVP.</p><p>Brady is known for his length of success; he is the only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three different decades, the oldest NFL MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, the oldest quarterback chosen for the Pro Bowl at age 44, and the oldest quarterback to start a game at age 45. Brady was unanimously selected to the 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019. He is the only NFL quarterback to be voted to two all-decade teams in&nbsp;the 2000s and 2010s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Brady Parents</h2><p>Tom Brady was born to Thomas Brady Sr. and Galynn Patricia Brady.
