The <a href=# rel>career of Scott Storch</a> began decades ago as he was mapping out his successes. His contributions to The Roots made him a global sensation, but Storch's reach didn't end there. Many hits we deem classics were created by the megaproducer who has worked with Beyoncé, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ja Rule</a>, T-Pain, Jennifer Lopez, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sean Paul</a>, Mario, Ludacris, and several others of the industry's elite.</p><p>We've pulled together seven of Scott Storch's biggest hits—however, we recognize that this list could go on and on. Additionally, this collection, by no means, is meant to read as his "best" songs; that debate is never-ending. This is more of a celebration of decades of career-topping success and a walk down memory lane. Take a look at our list of some of Scott Storch's biggest hits that have gone down in Hip Hop history. Let us know what your favorite Storch production is after revisiting these classics.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. "Still D.R.E." - Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Dogg (1999)</h2></span><p><a href=# rel>Hip Hop's Golden Era</a> arguably hosts some of the genre's most memorable productions. In 1999, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg dominated with "Still D.R.E.," a track that hosts an iconic Scott Storch piano riff. The song became a cultural milestone, and with over 1 billion views on YouTube, few Rap songs hold similar weight. "Still D.R.E." was featured on Dre's sophomore studio album, 2001, which also featured repeated collaborators <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kurupt</a>, Xzibit, Eminem, and Nate Dogg.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. "Lean Back" - Terror Squad feat. <a href=# class=text-word>Fat Joe</a> & Remy Ma (2004)</h2></span><p>Terror Squad was one of many Rap collectives out of the Big Apple, but they packed a lyrical punch. Led by the likes of Fat Joe and Remy Ma, the Squad erupted in 2004 with "Lean Back." It became an instant hit, thanks to Storch's ability to easily craft club-bangers. Further, the New York party scene was reflected in the track and the music video, making this a Hip Hop staple.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. "Candy Shop" - 50 Cent feat. Olivia (2005)</h2></span><p>Although we haven't received much <a href=# rel>new music from Olivia</a> over the years, the singer's voice is etched into Rap history. She assisted 50 Cent on his chart-topping hit "Candy Shop," a song that hosts one of Storch's many memorable productions. When New York City emcees were battling it out by beasting rough bars about the street life, Fif eased in with a seductive-ish song that spoke to an audience of women. It represented the pinnacle of 50 Cent's commercial success, earning him international acclaim and solidifying his position as a Hip Hop superstar.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. "Run It!" - Chris Brown (2005)</h2></span><p>Today, fans debate if Chris Brown should be hailed as better than Michael Jackson. As the updated King of Pop discussions rage on, we're looking back at C. Breezy's beginning. In 2005, Storch helped catapult Chris Brown into superstardom with "Run It!" It was Brown's breakout hit, showing his versatility as an artist. Displaying these talents at a young age would lay the foundation for an illustrious career. The perfect blend of Pop and R&B solidified Chris as a leader in the space, and he hasn't let up since.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. "Let Me Love You" - Mario (2004)</h2></span><p>Another catchy Storch production that we haven't been able to get out of our heads is Mario's "Let Me Love You." This romantic hit is a staple in the singer's catalog and has gone down in history as one of his most beloved tracks. "Let Me Love You" was one of the most successful R&B songs of the 2000s. Storch is also credited as a co-writer of the song, as well.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. "Naughty Girl" - Beyoncé (2003)</h2></span><p>This was a single that stirred up controversy, but not because of its producer. Scott Storch has repeatedly worked with Beyoncé, and this time, they added Sean Paul to the mix. "Naught Girl" was also included on Bey's Dangerously in Love album, and like others, it was quickly a fan favorite. <a href=# rel>There was controversy</a> surrounding Bey, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jay-Z</a>, and Sean Paul as the years moved forward. However, despite those conversations, "Naughty Girl" remains a smash hit for all parties involved.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-just-a-lil-bit-50-cent-2005>1. "Just a Lil Bit" - 50 Cent (2005)</h2></span><p>Scott Storch produced "Just a Lil Bit" for 50 Cent in 2005, adding another sultry Rap track to both their catalogs. Early in his career, 50 Cent was the definition of a romantic thug, and he capitalized on the label. Not only was he able to garner support from the streets, but his fanbase of women was growing with each new track. Additionally, the song remains a fan favorite and a staple in any party or club playlist, reflecting its cultural significance as an anthem of the Hip Hop genre.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbH10fZBmqpynpKl6tMDOq5qhZZiewbQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f670311-scott-storch-hits.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./scream-spooks-the-whole-of-tiktok-after-ghostface-shares-a-pulse-pounding-asmr-knife-session.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./scream-spooks-the-whole-of-tiktok-after-ghostface-shares-a-pulse-pounding-asmr-knife-session.html>Scream spooks the whole of TikTok after Ghostface shares a pulse-pounding ASMR knife session</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sal-mineo-net-worth-182319.html>Sal Mineo Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sal-mineo-net-worth-182319.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
